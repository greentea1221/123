            "U.S. health officials say 4.4 million Americans have rolled up their sleeves for the updated COVID-19 booster shot. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention posted the count Thursday as public health experts bemoaned President Joe Biden’s recent remark that “the pandemic is over.”",
            "The White House said more than 5 million people received the new boosters by its own estimate that accounts for reporting lags in states.",
            "Health experts said it is too early to predict whether demand would match up with the 171 million doses of the new boosters the U.S. ordered for the fall.",
            "“No one would go looking at our flu shot uptake at this point and be like, ‘Oh, what a disaster,’” said Dr. David Dowdy, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “If we start to see a large uptick in cases, I think we’re going to see a lot of people getting the (new COVID) vaccine.”",
            "A temporary shortage of Moderna vaccine caused some pharmacies to cancel appointments while encouraging people to reschedule for a Pfizer vaccine. The issue was expected to resolve as government regulators wrapped up an inspection and cleared batches of vaccine doses for distribution.",
            "“I do expect this to pick up in the weeks ahead,” said White House COVID-19 coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha. “We’ve been thinking and talking about this as an annual vaccine like the flu vaccine. Flu vaccine season picks up in late September and early October. We’re just getting our education campaign going. So we expect to see, despite the fact that this was a strong start, we actually expect this to ramp up stronger.”",
            "Some Americans who plan to get the shot, designed to target the most common omicron strains, said they are waiting because they either had COVID-19 recently or another booster. They are following public health advice to wait several months to get the full benefit of their existing virus-fighting antibodies.",
            "Others are scheduling shots closer to holiday gatherings and winter months when respiratory viruses spread more easily.",
            "Retired hospital chaplain Jeanie Murphy, 69, of Shawnee, Kansas, plans to get the new booster in a couple of weeks after she has some minor knee surgery. Interest is high among her neighbors from what she sees on the Nextdoor app.",
            "“There’s quite a bit of discussion happening among people who are ready to make appointments,” Murphy said. “I found that encouraging. For every one naysayer there will be 10 or 12 people who jump in and say, ‘You’re crazy. You just need to go get the shot.’”",
            "Biden later acknowledged criticism of his remark about the pandemic being over and clarified the pandemic is “not where it was.” The initial comment didn’t bother Murphy. She believes the disease has entered a steady state when “we’ll get COVID shots in the fall the same as we do flu shots.”",
            "Experts hope she’s right, but are waiting to see what levels of infection winter brings. The summer ebb in case numbers, hospitalizations and deaths may be followed by another surge, Dowdy said.",
            "Dr. Anthony Fauci, asked Thursday by a panel of biodefense experts what still keeps him up at night, noted that half of vaccinated Americans never got an initial booster dose.",
            "“We have a vulnerability in our population that will continue to have us in a mode of potential disruption of our social order,” Fauci said. “I think that we have to do better as a nation.”",
            "Some Americans who got the new shots said they are excited about the idea of targeting the vaccine to the variants circulating now.",
            "“Give me all the science you can,” said Jeff Westling, 30, an attorney in Washington, D.C., who got the new booster and a flu shot on Tuesday, one in each arm. He participates in the combat sport jujitsu, so wants to protect himself from infections that may come with close contact. “I have no issue trusting folks whose job it is to look at the evidence.”",
            "Meanwhile, Biden’s pronouncement in a “60 Minutes” interview broadcast Sunday echoed through social media.",
            "“We still have a problem with COVID. We’re still doing a lot of work on it. But the pandemic is over,” Biden said while walking through the Detroit auto show. “If you notice, no one’s wearing masks. Everybody seems to be in pretty good shape. And so I think it’s changing.”",
            "By Wednesday on Facebook, when a Kansas health department posted where residents could find the new booster shots, the first commenter remarked snidely:",
            "“But Biden says the pandemic is over.”",
            "The president’s statement, despite his attempts to clarify it, adds to public confusion, said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy with the Kaiser Family Foundation in Washington.",
            "“People aren’t sure when is the right time to get boosted. ‘Am I eligible?’ People are often confused about what the right choice is for them, even where to search for that information,” Michaud said.",
            "“Any time you have mixed messages, it’s detrimental to the public health effort,” Michaud said. “Having the mixed messages from the president’s remarks, makes that job that much harder.”",
            "University of South Florida epidemiologist Jason Salemi said he’s worried the president’s pronouncement has taken on a life of its own and may stall prevention efforts.",
            "“That soundbite is there for a while now, and it’s going to spread like wildfire. And it’s going to give the impression that ‘Oh, there’s nothing more we need to do,’” Salemi said.",
            "“If we’re happy with 400 or 500 people dying every single day from COVID, there’s a problem with that,” Salemi said. “We can absolutely do better because most of those deaths, if not all of them, are absolutely preventable with the tools that we have.”",
            "New York City photographer Vivienne Gucwa, 44, got the new booster Monday. She’s had COVID twice, once before vaccines were available and again in May. She was vaccinated with two Moderna shots, but never got the original boosters.",
            "“When I saw the new booster was able to tackle omicron variant I thought, ‘I’m doing that,’” Gucwa said.",
            "“I don’t want to deal with omicron again. I was kind of thrilled to see the boosters were updated.”",

            "A volatile passenger has been charged with a federal crime — and banned for life from American Airlines — after he was captured on video punching a flight attendant in the head, according to Justice Department and airline officials.",
            "The incident occurred Wednesday on a flight from San José del Cabo in Mexico to Los Angeles.",
            "Alexander Tung Cuu Le, 33, of Westminster, in Southern California, was arrested when the aircraft landed at Los Angeles International Airport, according to an American Airlines official. He was charged Thursday with one count of interference with flight crew members and attendants, which carries a maximum penalty of up to 20 years in prison, said a statement by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California. According to the statement, Le grabbed a flight attendant’s shoulder and demanded coffee about 20 minutes after the aircraft took off. He also allegedly disrupted passengers by hanging out near the first-class section of the cabin. When another flight attendant told Le to return to his assigned seat, Le “allegedly stood up and assumed a fighting stance towards the flight attendant by making closed fists with both of his hands, which the flight attendant interpreted as a threat,” according to the DOJ statement. A video taken by fellow passenger Barrie Livingstone shows Le apparently initially swinging his arm at the flight attendant but missing. As the attendant turned to walk away, Le can be seen rushing forward to strike the attendant in the head, eliciting cries of concern and outrage on the aircraft. The attack was “witnessed by several passengers,” the Justice Department said.  Le then “fled” to the back of the plane, where he was “apprehended by several passengers” and crew members, the statement added. Le’s “hands and legs were cuffed,” but he “continuously unbuckled his seatbelt, causing flight attendants to restrain him to the seat with seatbelt extenders,” officials noted. Le has been barred from all future flights by American Airlines. “Acts of violence against our team members are not tolerated by American Airlines,” said a statement from American. “The individual involved in this incident will never be allowed to travel with us in the future, and we will work closely with law enforcement in their investigation.” The airline thanked crew members and passengers for restraining Le until the aircraft was met by law enforcement at LAX.  Le appeared Thursday at the U.S. District Court in downtown Los Angeles, where he was charged. The hearing was continued to Monday, Ciaran McEvoy, a spokesperson for the U.S. attorney’s office, told SFGate. “That will be a detention hearing to determine his bond, if any. Mr. Le has not pleaded to anything yet,” McEvoy added. Attacks on flight attendants have skyrocketed in the last two years, largely triggered by sometimes violent, defiant responses to requirements to wear masks earlier in the COVID-19 pandemic. The Federal Aviation Administration logged an incredible 5,981 “unruly passenger reports last year. In 2020, the FAA investigated only 183 reports."

            "A white woman who said that she was unfairly fired and branded a racist by her former employer after calling the cops on a Black bird-watcher in a New York park ― leading social media users to dub her “Central Park Karen” ― has had a discrimination lawsuit thrown out.",
            "U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams on Wednesday dismissed the suit filed by Amy Cooper against investment firm Franklin Templeton, determining that her allegations of discrimination on the basis of race and sex — as well as defamation, negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress — were unsubstantiated.",
            "“We are pleased that the court has dismissed the lawsuit. We continue to believe the company responded appropriately,” a representative for Franklin Templeton said in a statement to HuffPost.",
            "The company announced Cooper’s termination on social media shortly after video of her May 2020 encounter with a man named Christian Cooper ― with whom she shares no relation ― went viral. He had asked her to leash her dog in the park, prompting the woman to call 911 and accuse the bird-watcher of threatening her.",
            "“I’m going to tell them there’s an African American man threatening my life,” she said in the video.",
            "Prosecutors, who charged her with filing a false report, said that Cooper also made a second 911 call in which she claimed that a Black man “tried to assault her in the Ramble area of the park.” A judge last year agreed to drop the criminal charge against her after she completed five sessions of an educational program that included instruction about racial bias.",
            "Franklin Templeton quickly placed Cooper on administrative leave over the incident, before tweeting that the company had fired her after an internal review.",
            "“We do not tolerate racism of any kind at Franklin Templeton,” it said at the time.",
            "Cooper’s lawsuit accused the company of making defamatory statements against her in that tweet and claimed that an internal investigation was not performed.",
            "However, Abrams ruled that merely watching video of the incident and holding a discussion within the company would “meet a reasonable interpretation of ‘internal review.’”",
            "“Plaintiff may take issue with the sufficiency of Defendants’ investigation into the incident, but she has not plausibly alleged that no investigation was conducted at all,” the judge said this week.",
            "If someone inferred that the company was calling Cooper a racist in its tweet, that would constitute “protected opinion,” according to Abrams.",
            "“It is well-established that an accusation of bigotry is a protected statement of opinion, rather than a defamatory statement of fact capable of being proven true or false,” she said.",
            "An attorney for Cooper did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment Thursday."

            "CAGUAS, Puerto Rico (AP) — More than a half million people in Puerto Rico remained without water service three days after Hurricane Fiona slammed into the U.S. territory, and many spent hours in lines Wednesday to fill jugs from water trucks while others scooped water from mountain runoff.",
            "Sweat rolled down the faces of people in a long line of cars in the northern mountain town of Caguas, where the government had sent a water truck, one of at least 18 so-called “oases” set up across the island.",
            "The situation was maddening for many people across an island once again left without basic services following a storm.",
            "“We thought we had a bad experience with Maria, but this was worse,” Gerardo Rodríguez said in the southern coastal town of Salinas, referring to the 2017 hurricane that caused nearly 3,000 deaths and demolished the island’s power grid.",
            "Fiona dumped roughly two feet of rain on parts of Puerto Rico before blasting across the eastern Dominican Republic and the Turks and Caicos Islands.",
            "Swelled to Category 4 force, the storm was on a track to pass close by Bermuda early Friday and then hit easternmost Canada early Saturay, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.",
            "The storm played havoc with Puerto Rico’s electrical grid, which had been patched but never fully rebuilt after Maria caused a blackout that lasted 11 months in some places.",
            "As of Wednesday afternoon, roughly 70% of Puerto Rican customers lacked electricity, according to government figures.",
            "In Caguas, the air conditioning of Emayra Veguilla’s car wasn’t working, so the bus driver propped up a small fan in the passenger seat. Earlier, she had blasted the song “Hijos del Canaveral” (“Sons of the Sugarcane Field”), written by Puerto Rican hip-hop star René Pérez as an ode to Puerto Rico and its people’s bravery.",
            "“I needed a shot of patriotism,” she said. “I needed strength to do this once again.”",
            "Veguilla had waited in line Tuesday, only to be told that the water had run out and that another truck would not be available until Wednesday.",
            "Some people ahead of Veguilla gave up and drove away, with tensions running high the longer people waited.",
            "“Move!” yelled one driver, fearful of people trying to cut in.",
            "Some who saw the line opted instead to drive to a nearby highway where fresh water trickled down the mountainside via a bamboo pipe that someone had installed.",
            "Greg Reyes, an English teacher, stood in line in muddy flip-flops to collect water for himself, his girlfriend and their cat. He had brought a large bag holding all the empty containers he could find in their house, including more than a dozen small water bottles.",
            "Reyes said he and his partner had been buying water since Fiona hit, but couldn’t afford to do so any longer.",
            "Standing behind him was retiree William Rodríguez, surrounded by three large buckets and four gallon containers. He had been living in Massachusetts and decided to return to Puerto Rico about six months ago.",
            "“But I think I’m leaving again,” he said as he shook his head.",
            "Those in the line grumbled about the slow pace of recovery and accused the government of not helping them as people on social media and even a gym said their doors were open to anyone who needed water or a shower.",
            "“This hasn’t been easy,” said Juan Santos, a retiree who held the hand of his 5-year-old grandson. “We are suffering.”",
            "None of those in line had power either, and many wondered if it would take as long to restore as it did with Hurricane Maria.",
            "Power company officials initially said it would take a few days for electricity to be restored, but then appeared to backtrack Tuesday night, saying they faced numerous obstacles.",
            "“Hurricane Fiona has severely impacted electrical infrastructure and generation facilities throughout the island. We want to make it very clear that efforts to restore and reenergize continue and are being affected by severe flooding, impassable roads, downed trees, deteriorating equipment, and downed lines,” said Luma, the company that operates power transmission and distribution.",
            "Officials said crews found several substations underwater and inaccessible.",
            "But Luma said it expected to restore power Wednesday to much of Puerto Rico’s north coast, which Fiona largely spared.",
            "The hum of generators could be heard across the territory as people became increasingly exasperated.",
            "“I continue to hope that by the end of today, a large part of the population will have these services,” said Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi.",
            "The head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency traveled to Puerto Rico on Tuesday and the agency announced it was sending hundreds of additional personnel to boost local response efforts. On Wednesday, U.S. President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration, which would allow for more federal assistance.",
            "Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency in Puerto Rico and deployed a couple of teams to the island.",
            "In the Turks and Caicos Islands, officials reported relatively light damage and no deaths, though the eye of the Category 4 storm passed close to Grand Turk, the small British territory’s capital island, on Tuesday.",
            "“Turks and Caicos had a phenomenal experience over the past 24 hours,” said Deputy Gov. Anya Williams. “It certainly came with its share of challenges.”",
            "Officials said school on Grand Turk would reopen next week.",
            "The Hurricane Center said Fiona had maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 kph) late Wednesday. It was centered about 550 miles (885 kilometers) southwest of Bermuda, heading north at 10 mph (17 kph).",
            "Fiona killed a man in the French overseas department of Guadeloupe and two others in Puerto Rico swept away by swollen rivers. Two died in the Dominican Republic: one killed by a falling tree and the other by a falling electric post.",
            "Two additional deaths were reported in Puerto Rico as a result of the blackout: A 70-year-old man burned to death after he tried to fill his running generator with gasoline and a 78-year-old man police say inhaled toxic gases from his generator.",

            "“We inherit our family’s dreams, but also their fears. It takes a lot of courage to make your own path.”",
            "That line of narration from the new documentary “Mija” — spoken by one of its subjects, musician and music manager Doris Muñoz — has stuck with me for months since its Sundance Film Festival premiere in January.",
            "The documentary follows Muñoz and two of her clients: first, singer/songwriter Cuco and later, singer/songwriter Jacks Haupt. Muñoz’s success as a manager representing fellow Latinx artists has provided material support to her family. In the film, her parents are undergoing the arduous and bureaucratic process of applying for green cards. Muñoz, the only U.S.-born member of her immediate family, is also the liaison between them and her brother, who lives across the border in Tijuana after he was deported.",
            "In “Mija,” Muñoz and Haupt grapple with a lot of complicated feelings that are familiar to many children of immigrants, especially those trying to make it in a creative profession. They want to live up to their parents’ expectations and make them proud, and feel obligated to help them and honor their enormous sacrifices. Amid all of that, they’re figuring out how to make it in a field where there aren’t a lot of people like them.",
            "Premiering Friday on Disney+, “Mija” is the feature debut of director Isabel Castro. She previously spent a decade in journalism, producing documentary shorts and series at the New York Times, the Marshall Project and VICE, where she was an Emmy-nominated producer for “VICE News Tonight.” As she explained in an interview, the seed for “Mija” came from a desire to tell more nuanced stories about immigration — not just about the act of immigrating or the policies behind it, but the complex emotions it brings up and “the ripple effects across different generations.”",
            "“The range of emotions that comes along with immigrating to this country is really, really nuanced and complicated, and the spectrum is really wide,” she said. “Oftentimes, immigrant stories are very narrowly focused on exclusively the trauma of that experience.”",
            "It’s the kind of story Castro has wanted to tell for many years, and the intersection of several of her creative goals. As a Mexican American journalist covering immigration and civil rights in the Trump era, Castro “started to feel really disillusioned by the kind of aspirations towards objectivity,” she said. “Just looking at the ways that different government policies were affecting folks on the ground, it was very difficult for me to really try to maintain objectivity.”",
            "Castro, who has a background in filmmaking but cut her teeth in journalism and documentary TV work to build a more steady career path, quit her day job and used her savings to get back into independent film. She took a course in cinematography to be able to work independently and reduce costs, since getting a film funded can be a long and cumbersome process.",
            "When considering what story she wanted to tell, she remembered that “I’ve always loved music docs. So I thought, ‘Oh, maybe there’s a way to have a music doc intersect with a story about immigration,’” she said. “And that’s kind of the seed that was planted.”",
            "In 2019, Castro came across a California Sunday magazine profile about Cuco, which mentioned the work Muñoz was doing as his manager. After several phone conversations with Muñoz, Castro met her in person later that year at “Selena for Sanctuary,” a concert paying homage to the late singer and icon Selena. A few years earlier, Muñoz began the event as a way to raise money for her parents’ legal fees, and later grew it into a fundraiser for immigrant rights organizations. Soon after the two met, Muñoz agreed to be part of the documentary.",
            "When deciding to move away from journalism and make her own feature film, Castro also wanted to be able to make more specific stylistic choices. “There’s objectivity, also, in the vernacular of imagery that journalism is told in. And I wanted to make something that felt really subjective, that felt really intentional about its POV and about the image itself being part of the messaging and the story,” she said.",
            "For instance, “Mija” features a vibrant color palette and dream-like sequences, which were inspired by HBO’s “Euphoria.” “In terms of trying to react to or deviate from the typical ways that immigrant stories are told, I really wanted to adopt a visual language that felt really young and exciting, and so I looked a lot to ‘Euphoria,’” she said.",
            "In choosing to have Muñoz narrate the documentary, Castro drew from the voiceover of characters like Cher Horowitz in “Clueless” and Carrie Bradshaw in “Sex and the City,” which she loved as a teen. “I really connected to Carrie and Cher, despite our huge differences, just because of the VO. I felt like there was an intimacy that was established through the voiceover,” she said. “So I always knew that I wanted to emulate that in the voiceover for the film.”",
            "Like everything else in the world, the pandemic shifted Muñoz’s life and the course of the documentary, forcing Castro to get creative with the production limitations. “I went into this thinking it would be a more traditional music doc. I thought I’d be on the road. I thought it was going to be a Chicano ‘Almost Famous,’” she said. “But the pandemic hit, and my expectations just completely went out the window.”",
            "While we didn’t get that road movie version of “Mija,” the film’s intimate moments of reflection lend itself well to the complicated questions it explores — the kind that don’t fit into a pithy headline or neat narrative.",
            "For children of immigrants, in some ways, perhaps the ultimate gift to our parents is to get to make the choices they couldn’t, and to be able to move beyond basic questions of survival and material needs. But it also can be hard for our parents to understand our choices, and we can feel a sense of guilt for being able to focus on less material concerns than they did.",
            "“One of the emotions that I personally carry with me and most wanted to explore in this was the feeling of guilt,” Castro said. “And I think that that’s particularly prevalent in the stories of immigrants because migration just is inherently a traumatic experience. No matter what your story is, it’s a decision to leave your home, and it’s a decision to leave your country and your culture and move to a new place. And it’s painful.”",
            "“And I think that as children of immigrants, oftentimes you see that pain or interpret that pain, and you want to honor it,” she continued. “And sometimes, that comes along with a lot of pressure, and that pressure often comes along with feelings of guilt. So I wanted to explore those kinds of emotions. I wanted the film to live not just exclusively in the trauma of immigration, because that’s always going to be there in our lives, in our stories and in our day-to-day experiences.”",
            "Castro wants more immigration stories to capture these more complicated feelings and questions.",
            "“The nuanced emotions are the ones that I think come up more often on a day-to-day basis,” she continued. “Having covered immigration for many, many years, that is the reality of most people’s experiences that I see. It’s not something black and white.”",
            "“Mija” premieres Friday on Disney+."

            "NEW YORK (AP) — President Joe Biden is ready to make the case to world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly that Russia’s “naked aggression” in Ukraine is an affront to the heart of what the international body stands for as he looks to rally allies to stand firm in backing the Ukrainian resistance.",
            "Biden, during his time at the U.N. General Assembly, also planned to meet Wednesday with new British Prime Minister Liz Truss, announce a global food security initiative and press allies to meet an $18 billion target to replenish the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.",
            "But White House officials say the crux of the president’s visit to the U.N. this year would be a full-throated condemnation of Russia as its brutal war nears the seven-month mark.",
            "“He’ll offer a firm rebuke of Russia’s unjust war in Ukraine and make a call to the world to continue to stand against the naked aggression that we’ve seen these past several months,” White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in previewing the president’s address. “He will underscore the importance of strengthening the United Nations and reaffirm core tenets of its charter at a time when a permanent member of the Security Council has struck at the very heart of the charter by challenging the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty.”",
            "The address comes as Russian-controlled regions of eastern and southern Ukraine have announced plans to hold Kremllin-backed referendums in days ahead on becoming part of Russia and as Moscow is losing ground in the invasion. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday announced a partial mobilization to call up 300,000 reservists and accused the West of engaging in “nuclear blackmail.”",
            "Biden is confronting no shortage of difficult issues as leaders gather this year.",
            "In addition to the Russian war in Ukraine, European fears that a recession could be just around the corner are heightened. Administration concerns grow by the day that time is running short to revive the Iran nuclear deal and over China’s saber-rattling on Taiwan.",
            "When he addressed last year’s General Assembly, Biden focused on broad themes of global partnership, urging world leaders to act with haste against the coronavirus, climate change and human rights abuses. And he offered assurances that his presidency marked a return of American leadership to international institutions following Donald Trump’s “America First” foreign policy.",
            "But one year later, global dynamics have dramatically changed.",
            "Stewart Patrick, senior fellow and director of the Global Order and Institutions Program at the Washington think tank Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote in an analysis that Biden’s task this year is “immense” compared to his first address to the U.N. as president.",
            "“Last year, the U.S. leader won easy plaudits as the ‘anti-Trump,’ pledging that ‘America was back,’” Patrick said. “This year demands more. The liberal, rules-based international system is reeling, battered by Russian aggression, Chinese ambitions, authoritarian assaults, a halting pandemic recovery, quickening climate change, skepticism of the U.N.’s relevance, and gnawing doubts about American staying power.”",
            "Beyond diplomacy, the president is also doing some politicking. This year’s gathering comes less than seven weeks before pivotal midterm elections in the United States. Shortly after arriving in Manhattan on Tuesday night, Biden spoke at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser for about 100 participants that raised nearly $2 million, and he’s set to hold another fundraiser on Thursday before heading back to Washington.",
            "His Wednesday address comes on the heels of Ukrainian forces retaking control of large stretches of territory near Kharkiv. But even as Ukrainian forces have racked up battlefield wins, much of Europe is feeling painful blowback from economic sanctions levied against Russia. A vast reduction in Russian oil and gas has led to a sharp jump in energy prices, skyrocketing inflation and growing risk of Europe slipping into a recession.",
            "Biden’s visit to the U.N. also comes as his administration’s efforts to revive the 2015 Iran nuclear deal appears stalled.",
            "The deal brokered by the Obama administration — and scrapped by Trump in 2018 — provided billions of dollars in sanctions relief in exchange for Iran’s agreement to dismantle much of its nuclear program and open its facilities to extensive international inspection.",
            "Sullivan said no breakthrough with Iran is expected during the General Assembly but Biden would make clear in his speech that a deal can still be done “if Iran is prepared to be serious about its obligations.” He added that administration officials would be consulting with fellow signatories of the 2015 deal on the sidelines of this week’s meetings.",
            "This year’s U.N. gathering is back to being a full-scale, in-person event after two years of curtailed activity due to the pandemic. In 2020, the in-person gathering was canceled and leaders instead delivered prerecorded speeches; last year was a mix of in-person and prerecorded speeches. Biden and first lady Jill Biden were set to host a leaders’ reception on Wednesday evening.",
            "China’s President Xi Jinping opted not to attend this year’s U.N. gathering, but his country’s conduct and intentions will loom large during the leaders’ talks.",
            "Last month, the U.N. human rights office raised concerns about possible “crimes against humanity” in China’s western region against Uyghurs and other largely Muslim ethnic groups. Beijing has vowed to suspend cooperation with the office and blasted what it described as a Western plot to undermine China’s rise.",
            "Meanwhile, China’s government on Monday said Biden’s statement in a CBS “60 Minutes” interview that American forces would defend Taiwan if Beijing tried to invade the self-ruled island was a violation of U.S. commitments on the matter, but it gave no indication of possible retaliation.",
            "The White House said after the interview that there has been no change in U.S. policy on Taiwan, which China claims as its own. That policy says Washington wants to see Taiwan’s status resolved peacefully but doesn’t say whether U.S. forces might be sent in response to a Chinese attack.",

            "GENEVA (AP) — FIFA came under pressure Wednesday from several European soccer federations who want their captains to wear an armband with a rainbow heart design during World Cup games in Qatar to campaign against discrimination.",
            "France and Germany, the last two World Cup champions, were among eight of the 13 European soccer teams going to Qatar who joined the “One Love” campaign, which started in the Netherlands. The Dutch team plays Qatar in Group A on Nov. 29.",
            "FIFA rules prohibit teams from bringing their own armband designs to the World Cup and insist they must use equipment provided by the governing body.",
            "Armbands are the latest battleground for players to push political messages linked to the World Cup hosted in Qatar, where homosexual acts are illegal and the treatment of migrant workers building projects for the tournament has been a decade-long controversy.",
            "“Wearing the armband together on behalf of our teams will send a clear message when the world is watching,” England captain Harry Kane said in a statement.",
            "The Swiss soccer federation said it wanted captain Granit Xhaka to wear an armband on which “you can see a heart with diverse colors which represent the diversity of humanity.”",
            "Soccer players have embraced their platform to make statements in recent years. Taking a knee on the field was routine before Premier League games for two seasons after the death of George Floyd, a Black man killed by a police officer in the United States.",
            "FIFA supported taking a knee and now has to decide whether to back some of its most influential member federations in a gesture that could embarrass Qatar.",
            "“A request to FIFA has also been submitted asking that permission be provided for the armbands to be worn throughout the FIFA World Cup,” the Welsh soccer federation said in a statement.",
            "FIFA did not immediately comment on the request.",
            "The armbands can be worn at UEFA-organized games in the Nations League this week, including by both captains when Belgium hosts Wales on Thursday.",
            "The campaign for the armbands was launched one day after the Emir of Qatar spoke at the United Nations General Assembly in New York promising a World Cup without discrimination.",
            "“The Qatari people will receive with open arms football fans from all walks of life,” Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani said in a speech to other world leaders.",
            "The eight European teams backing the “One Love” campaign for human rights also included Belgium and Denmark. The five European qualifiers for the World Cup not taking part Wednesday were Croatia, Poland, Portugal, Serbia and Spain.",
            "However, Poland captain Robert Lewandowski — a two-time FIFA world player of the year — said this week he would take an armband in the blue and yellow colors of Ukraine’s flag to Qatar.",
            "Poland refused to play Russia, the 2018 World Cup host, in a playoff match in March. Before the game, FIFA and European soccer body UEFA banned Russian teams from international competitions because the country invaded Ukraine.",
            "The campaign for the armbands emerged while a panel of UEFA member federations monitored progress in Qatar on labor law reforms and other human rights ahead of the tournament.",
            "That panel includes the Norwegian soccer federation, whose president Lise Klaveness delivered a scathing criticism of the Qatari project at an annual FIFA meeting in March in Doha on the eve of the tournament draw.",
            "England and Wales were among the federations Wednesday acknowledging progress made in Qatar since the wealthy emirate won the World Cup hosting vote in December 2010.",
            "However, the English federation said players would meet with some migrant workers who will be invited to its training camp in Al Wakrah.",
            "England also added to support already expressed in Germany this week for FIFA and World Cup organizers to compensate the families of construction workers who came to Qatar to help build stadiums, metro lines and hotels.",
            "Amnesty International has suggested FIFA should pay $440 million in reparations to equal the prize money being paid to the 32 teams in Qatar.",
            "At a German federation event on Monday, an invited fan who is gay used the platform to urge the Qatari ambassador that his country should abolish laws against homosexuality. The ambassador, Abdulla bin Mohammed bin Saud Al Thani, complained that human rights issues were distracting from the tournament.",

            "TOKYO (AP) — A man set himself on fire near the Japanese prime minister’s office in Tokyo on Wednesday in an apparent protest against the state funeral planned next week for former leader Shinzo Abe, officials and media reports said.",
            "The man, believed to be in his 70s, sustained burns on large parts of his body but was conscious and told police that he set himself on fire after pouring oil over himself, Kyodo News agency reported.",
            "A note was found with him that said, “Personally, I am absolutely against” Abe’s funeral, Kyodo reported.",
            "A Tokyo Fire Department official confirmed that a man set himself afire on the street in Tokyo’s Kasumigaseki government district and that he was alive when he was taken to a hospital by ambulance, but declined to give further details, including the man’s identity, motive or condition, citing the sensitivity of what was a police matter.",
            "Police called it an attempted suicide and refused to give further details because the case involved no criminal intent. Police also declined to comment on a report that a police officer was caught in the fire.",
            "The incident underscores a growing wave of protests against the funeral for Abe, who was one of the most divisive leaders in postwar Japanese politics because of his revisionist view of wartime history, support for a stronger military, and what critics call an autocratic approach and cronyism. More protests are expected in coming days, including the day of the funeral next week.",
            "It also is an embarrassment for police, who have stepped up security for an event expected to be attended by about 6,000 people, including U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and other dignitaries.",
            "Police were also partly blamed for insufficient protection of Abe, who was shot to death by a gunman who approached him from behind as he was giving an outdoor campaign speech in July.",
            "Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is in New York for the annual U.N. General Assembly meeting of world leaders. He gave a speech Tuesday expressing disappointment over the Security Council’s failure to respond to the Russian invasion of Ukraine because of Russia’s permanent veto and called for reforms that would allow the U.N. to better defend global peace and order.",
            "The planned state funeral for Abe has become increasingly unpopular among Japanese as more details emerge about the governing Liberal Democratic Party’s and Abe’s links to the Unification Church, which built close ties with party lawmakers over their shared interests in conservative causes.",
            "The suspect in Abe’s assassination reportedly believed his mother’s large donations to the church ruined his family. The LDP has said nearly half its lawmakers have ties to the church, but party officials have denied ties between the party as an organization and the church.",
            "Kishida has said Abe deserves the honor of a state funeral as Japan’s longest-serving post-World War II leader and for his diplomatic and economic achievements.",
            "Critics have said it was decided undemocratically and is an inappropriate and costly use of taxpayers’ money. They say Kishida decided to hold a state funeral to please Abe’s party faction and buttress his own power. Support ratings for Kishida’s government have weakened amid public dissatisfaction over his handling of the party’s church ties and the funeral plans.",
            "A family funeral for Abe was held at a Buddhist temple in July. The state funeral is scheduled for next Tuesday at the Budokan martial arts arena in Tokyo."

            "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Hurricane Fiona threatened to strengthen into a Category 4 storm Wednesday as it lashed the Turks and Caicos Islands and was forecast to squeeze past Bermuda later this week.",
            "The storm was blamed for causing at least four direct deaths in its march through the Caribbean, where it unleashed torrential rain in Puerto Rico, leaving a majority without power or water as hundreds of thousands of people scraped mud out of their homes following what authorities described as “historic” flooding.",
            "Power company officials initially said it would take a couple of days for electricity to be fully restored but then appeared to backtrack late Tuesday night.",
            "“Hurricane Fiona has severely impacted electrical infrastructure and generation facilities throughout the island. We want to make it very clear that efforts to restore and reenergize continue and are being affected by severe flooding, impassable roads, downed trees, deteriorating equipment, and downed lines,” said Luma, the company that operates power transmission and distribution.",
            "The hum of generators could be heard across the island as people became increasingly exasperated, with some still trying to recover from Hurricane Maria, which hit as a Category 4 storm five years ago, killing an estimated 2,975 people in its aftermath.",
            "Luis Noguera, who was helping clear a landslide in the central mountain town of Cayey, said Maria left him without power for a year.",
            "“We paid an electrician out of our own pocket to connect us,” he recalled, adding that he doesn’t think the government will be of much help again after Fiona.",
            "Long lines were reported at several gas stations across Puerto Rico, and some pulled off a main highway to collect water from a stream.",
            "“We thought we had a bad experience with Maria, but this was worse,” said Gerardo Rodríguez, who lives in the southern coastal town of Salinas.",
            "Parts of the island had received more than 25 inches (64 centimeters) of rain and more had fallen on Tuesday.",
            "By late Tuesday, authorities said they had restored power to nearly 300,000 of the island’s 1.47 million customers, while water service was cut to more than 760,000 customers — two thirds of the total on the island.",
            "The head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency traveled to Puerto Rico on Tuesday as the agency announced it was sending hundreds of additional personnel to boost local response efforts.",
            "Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency on the island and deployed a couple of teams to the U.S. territory.",
            "In the Turks and Caicos Islands, officials reported minimal damage and no deaths despite the storm’s eye passing close to Grand Turk, the small British territory’s capital island, on Tuesday morning.",
            "Th government had imposed a curfew and urged people to flee flood-prone areas.",
            "“Turks and Caicos had a phenomenal experience over the past 24 hours,” said Deputy Gov. Anya Williams. “It certainly came with its share of challenges.”",
            "Late Tuesday night, Fiona was centered about 95 miles (155 kilometers) north of NORTH CAICOS ISLAND, with hurricane-force winds extending up to 30 miles (45 kilometers) from the center. It had maximum sustained winds of 125 mph (205 kph) and was moving north at 8 mph (13 kph), according to the Hurricane Center, which said the storm was likely to strengthen into a Category 4 hurricane as it approaches Bermuda on Friday.",
            "The storm killed a man in the French Caribbean territory of Guadeloupe, another man in Puerto Rico who was swept away by a swollen river and two people in the Dominican Republic: one killed by a falling tree and the other by a falling electric post.",

            "He then said he actually intended to use the money to feed a gambling addiction to the game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, the website reported.",

            "He was born Valery Ivanovich Korshunov on April 27, 1942, but changed his name after being adopted in 1957, according to the New Mexico Museum of Space History. Polyakov began as a physician and joined the Institute of Biomedical Problems in Moscow in 1971, according to CNN.",
            "After undergoing spaceflight training to demonstrate he could administer assistance to fellow astronauts in orbit and passing his exams in 1972, Polyakov became one of the first doctor-cosmonaut trainees in history. He earned his Candidate of Medical Sciences degree in 1976.",

            "“When his capsule landed in Kazakhstan he walked from it to a nearby chair, a tremendous achievement,” wrote Baker. “He also stole a cigarette from a friend nearby, but could hardly be blamed for that. He sipped a small brandy and inwardly celebrated his mission.”",
            "While NASA astronauts Scott Kelly and Mark Vande Hei respectively spent 340 and 355 consecutive days in space and Peggy Whitson spent 665 cumulative days in space, the consecutive 437-day stay accomplished by Valery Polyakov remains unprecedented.",

            "The new Hulu comedy series “Reboot” is a curious product of this particular cultural era. It follows the reboot of a fictional early 2000s family sitcom, “Step Right Up,” and the tensions it places on its dysfunctional cast and crew.",
            "Among the stars of the show (and show within a show) are Keegan-Michael Key, Judy Greer and Johnny Knoxville, whose characters begrudgingly sign on for the reboot after many disappointing career and life changes since the original run. Paul Reiser — who was recently in a reboot of his own, with the 2019 revival of 1990s sitcom “Mad About You” — and Rachel Bloom play Gordon and Hannah, the father-daughter team of showrunners behind the relaunch of “Step Right Up.”",
            "Premiering Tuesday, the eight-episode series marks creator Steven Levitan’s first show since the long-running ABC sitcom “Modern Family.” HuffPost Senior Culture Reporters Marina Fang and Candice Frederick discuss what they thought of “Reboot” and assess where it fits into the larger cultural conversation on the topic.",
            "Marina Fang: All of us on the HuffPost culture desk talk a lot about the seemingly never-ending stream of reboots, revivals, re-imaginings, etc., etc. — what I often like to joke is the “reboot industrial complex.” So the idea of a sitcom about a fictional reboot of a sitcom, involving a lot of people who’ve been part of major sitcoms before, definitely piqued my interest. Candice, what did you think of “Reboot,” and how well do you think it captures this cultural moment we’re in?",
            "Candice Frederick: Yeah, the reboot industrial complex is real, and it’s exhausting. So, I went into “Reboot” fearing it would be a bit navel-gazey and unnecessary.",
            "But I was struck by how much it delves into what it means to actually go forward with a reboot, the human impact of it. Like, how the actors, who haven’t worked in forever — or who haven’t gotten the type of prestige work they thought would follow after the series — are ill-equipped to deal with the new celebrity industrial complex where media can be very vampiric with their personal questions, or what it means to bring a show from a certain period into present day.",
            "What’s to become of the original staff writers? Can they write dialogue that pertains or contends with today’s culture? What does that look like when they have to share a writing room with younger writers? The generational questions were interesting to me.",
            "What did you think going into it?",
            "Initial Thoughts",
            "MF: Absolutely, I had those exact same fears. But I think it finds the right balance in its meta jokes about the industry. For example, the show within a show, like the show itself, is being produced at Hulu, and one of the characters is a fictionalized Hulu executive. That was all very funny.",
            "Once I started watching it, I found myself wishing it had a sharper point of view about the concept of reboots — a specific thing it was trying to say about it all. But then, when you and I were deciding to do this “Should You Watch It?” article, you mentioned everything you said above. And I realized you’re totally right, that this is what really makes this show interesting.",
            "In the larger cultural discussion around reboots, we don’t talk as much about what it means for the actors and writers to return to something they made 20 years ago, that probably hasn’t aged well, and how they’re probably in a very different place in their lives and careers when they decide to do these reboots. This show does a great job of exploring those dynamics.",
            "Standout Performances",
            "MF: The dynamic between Bree and Reed (Greer and Key) felt totally lived-in. Like, I totally bought that they had a thing 20 years ago, and being together again is bringing up all kinds of messy feelings. I loved both of those performances, part of a really stacked cast on this show.",
            "Candice, what did you think of the cast, and were there any really standout performances for you?",
            "CF: OMG yes! Loved that the comedy exec at Hulu (Krista Marie Yu) is hyperserious and actually knows nothing about comedy. I’m sure this happens a lot in the industry.",
            "To your point, though, it did stick out to me that the show doesn’t have a point of view about reboots — especially since you and I both definitely do! But I also wonder if these folks who decide to do a reboot actually have a point of view on that. Some need the money. Others need their careers reinvigorated. Others, especially women like Judy Greer’s character, need to prove that they still have it and that the industry can’t send them out to pasture just yet. That was all very interesting to me.",
            "LOL, Judy and Keegan are comedy gold, totally agree. You know who I also thought was quite interesting? Alyah Chanelle Scott, who plays Timberly, who’s kind of a plant from the reality TV show industrial complex. She parlayed that into a scripted TV career. But when she tries to prove herself, of course people like Bree feel threatened. That was a totally unexpected storyline that actually made a lot of sense to me, and I think both women are very good there.",
            "What did you think of Johnny Knoxville and his character (who I admit I have never actually seen on anything before)? I intentionally avoided the whole “Jackass” phenomenon.",
            "MF: Yes, I liked how that all felt very real!",
            "I also have never watched any of the installments of the “Jackass” franchise. I did like that his character seemed pretty reflective of a washed-up, middle-aged white dude — like, you can easily picture a real-life equivalent.",
            "CF: Same! He is definitely a major source of comic relief but actually has gravitas. Like a whole lot of these characters, he’s been sort of just ... floating since this TV show. So, we get to see him really wrangle with that as well.",
            "So, there’s a whole other section of the show that could have possibly been its own series, which is the relationship between Rachel Bloom’s and Paul Reiser’s characters, Hannah and Gordon. As a stand-alone character, I think Gordon is actually more interesting as the returning showrunner who’s trying to navigate the new turf and having to partner with his daughter, Hannah. Hannah is the more unsure character, who’s still getting her feet wet. But we again see how these two generations can work together.",
            "MF: Yeah, I liked seeing the writers room, which is another place where the show could have gotten a bit too navel-gazey, but it really works. Gordon is used to doing things the old way: hiring all of his friends, writing a bunch of hacky, tired jokes, etc. Meanwhile, Hannah is trying to make a more substantive show and hire a more inclusive writers room. The way they are constantly at an impasse feels like a lot of what we see play out in real life.",
            "Were there any other high points for you, or anything else you wanted to shout out? I think it’s safe to say we both liked it.",
            "CF: Yes! The genuineness of their reactions really worked. Like, that is exactly how I would imagine it would be.",
            "Should “Reboot” Get Another Season?",
            "CF: I think one question that came to mind is whether this deserves another season. Like, do we want more of this story? Honestly, I’d watch. I think there is more story to mine here.",
            "MF: That’s a good question! Like a lot of streaming series, these eight episodes tell a complete story but also leave just enough of an opening for another season. I could go either way. If they do pick it up for a second season, I’d watch it.",
            "CF: Same! I’d like to know more about these people. Somewhat related: Did you ever watch the show “Unreal”? I think this would make a good companion piece because of what they both say about the human impact of putting on what are ultimately scripted TV shows.",
            "MF: Yes, I did watch and really liked “Unreal,” until it went off the rails in its later seasons. There was also a short-lived Fox show last year called “The Big Leap,” which is similar to “Unreal” but the show within a show is a dance competition series — another possibility, if you’re reading this and want to check out more of these shows with meta qualities about TV. Can we call them “Russian doll shows”? LOL.",
            "CF: Haha I love that — and now I have to find “The Big Leap”! Never even heard of it.",
            "So, Should You Watch It?",
            "MF: Anyway, should you watch “Reboot”? Definitely.",
            "CF: And yes, I really like “Reboot”! Would recommend."

            "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Maury Wills, who intimidated pitchers with his base-stealing prowess as a shortstop for the Los Angeles Dodgers on three World Series championship teams, has died. He was 89.",
            "Wills died Monday night at home in Sedona, Arizona, the team said Tuesday after being informed by family members. No cause of death was given.",
            "Wills played on World Series title teams in 1959, ’63 and ’65 during his first eight seasons with the Dodgers. He also played for Pittsburgh and Montreal before returning to the Dodgers from 1969-72, when he retired.",
            "During his 14-year career, Wills batted .281 with 2,134 hits and 586 stolen bases in 1,942 games.",
            "Wills broke Ty Cobb’s single-season record for stolen bases with his 97th swipe on Sept. 23, 1962. That season he became the first player to steal more than 100 bases.",
            "The Dodgers will wear a patch in memory of Wills for the rest of this season.",
            "“Maury Wills was one of the most exciting Dodgers of all time,” team president and CEO Stan Kasten said. “He changed baseball with his base-running and made the stolen base an important part of the game. He was very instrumental in the success of the Dodgers with three world championships.”",
            "Wills had an ill-fated stint managing the Seattle Mariners from 1980-81, going 26-56 with a winning percentage of .317.",
            "He was the National League Most Valuable Player in 1962, the same year he was MVP of the All-Star Game played in his hometown of Washington, D.C.",
            "Wills stayed at home with his family instead of at the team hotel for the All-Star Game. He arrived at the ballpark carrying a Dodgers bag and wearing a Dodgers shirt. However, the security guard wouldn’t let him in, saying he was too small to be a ballplayer.",
            "Wills suggested the guard escort him to the NL clubhouse door, where he would wait while the guard asked the players to confirm his identity.",
            "“So we walk down there and baseball players have a sick sense of humor, because when I stood in front of the door, with my Dodger shirt and duffel bag, and the man opened the door and said, ‘Anybody in here know this boy?’ and they all looked at me and said, ’Never saw him before,” Wills told The Washington Post in 2015.",
            "After the game, Wills left with his MVP trophy and showed it to the guard.",
            "“He still didn’t believe me, he thought maybe I was carrying it for somebody,” Wills told the Post.",
            "Wills led the NL in stolen bases from 1960-65, was a seven-time All-Star selection and won Gold Glove Awards in 1961 and ’62.",
            "He was credited with reviving the stolen base as a strategy. His speed made him a constant threat on the basepaths and he distracted pitchers even if he didn’t try to steal. He carefully studied pitchers and their pickoff moves when he wasn’t on base. When a pitcher’s throw drove him back to the bag, he became even more determined to steal.",
            "Once, in a game against the New York Mets, Wills was on first base when pitcher Roger Craig threw 12 straight times to the bag. On Craig’s next throw, Wills stole second.",
            "By age 32, Wills was bandaging his legs before games because of the punishment of sliding.",
            "After retiring with the Dodgers in 1972, Wills worked an analyst at NBC for five years. He also managed winter ball in the Mexican Pacific League, winning a league championship in 1970-71.",
            "Wills’ tenure managing the Mariners was largely regarded as a disaster and he was criticized for his lack of managerial experience. It was evident in the numerous gaffes he committed, including calling for a relief pitcher when nobody was warming up in the bullpen and holding up a game for several minutes while looking for a pinch hitter.",
            "Wills’ biggest mistake came on April 25, 1981, when he ordered the Mariners’ ground crew to extend the batter’s box a foot longer toward the mound than regulation allowed. Oakland manager Billy Martin noticed and asked home plate umpire Bill Kunkel to investigate.",
            "Kunkel questioned the head groundskeeper, who admitted Wills had ordered the change. Wills said it was to help his players stay in the box. However, Martin suspected it was to give the Mariners an advantage against Oakland’s breaking-ball pitchers. Wills was suspended for two games by the American League and fined $500.",
            "Wills led the Mariners to a 20-38 record to end the 1980 season, and he was fired on May 6, 1981, when the team was mired in last place at 6-18. Years later, Wills admitted he probably should have gotten more experience as a minor league manager before being hired in the big leagues.",
            "Wills struggled with addictions to alcohol and cocaine until getting sober in 1989. He credited Dodgers pitching great Don Newcombe, who overcame his own alcohol problems, with helping him. Newcombe died in 2109.",
            "“I’m standing here with the man who saved my life,” Wills said of Newcombe. “He was a channel for God’s love for me because he chased me all over Los Angeles trying to help me and I just couldn’t understand that. But he persevered, he wouldn’t give in and my life is wonderful today because of Don Newcombe.”",
            "Born Maurice Morning Wills in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 2, 1932, he was a three-sport standout at Cardozo Senior High. He earned All-City honors as a quarterback in football, in basketball and as a pitcher in baseball when he was nicknamed Sonny.",
            "In 1948, he played on the school’s undefeated football team, which never gave up any points. On the mound, Wills threw a one-hitter and struck out 17 in a game in 1950. The school’s baseball field is named in his honor.",
            "Wills has his own museum in Fargo, North Dakota, where he was a coach and instructor for the Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks from 1996-97.",
            "He is survived by wife Carla, and children Barry, Micki, Bump, Anita, Susan Quam and Wendi Jo Wills. Bump was a former major league second baseman who played for Texas and the Chicago Cubs.",

            "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian-controlled regions of eastern and southern Ukraine announced plans Tuesday to start voting this week to become integral parts of Russia. The concerted and quickening Kremlin-backed efforts to swallow up four regions could set the stage for Moscow to escalate the war following Ukrainian successes on the battlefield.",
            "The scheduling of referendums starting Friday in the Luhansk, Kherson and partly Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions came after a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin said the votes are needed and as Moscow is losing ground in the invasion it began nearly seven months ago, increasing pressure on the Kremlin for a stiff response.",
            "Former President Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia’s Security Council chaired by Putin, said referendums that fold regions into Russia itself would make redrawn frontiers “irreversible” and enable Moscow to use “any means” to defend them.",
            "Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba denounced the votes as a sham and tweeted that “Ukraine has every right to liberate its territories and will keep liberating them whatever Russia has to say.”",
            "The votes, in territory Russia already controls, are all but certain to go Moscow’s way but are unlikely to be recognized by Western governments who are backing Ukraine with military and other support that has helped its forces seize momentum on battlefields in the east and south.",
            "In Donetsk, part of Ukraine’s wider Donbas region that has been gripped by rebel fighting since 2014 and which Putin has set as a primary objective of the invasion, separatist leader Denis Pushilin said the vote will “restore historic justice” to the territory’s “long-suffering people.”",
            "They “have earned the right to be part of the great country that they always considered their motherland,” he said.",
            "In partly Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia, pro-Russia activist Vladimir Rogov said: “The faster we become part of Russia, the sooner peace will come.”",
            "Pressure inside Russia for votes and from Moscow-backed leaders in Ukrainian regions that Moscow controls increased after a Ukrainian counteroffensive — bolstered by Western-supplied weaponry — that has recaptured large areas.",
            "Former Kremlin speechwriter and Russian political analyst Abbas Gallyamov said on Facebook that Moscow-backed separatists appeared “scared that the Russians will abandon them” amid the Ukrainian offensive and forged ahead with referendum plans to force the Kremlin’s hand.",
            "In another signal that Russia is digging in for a protracted and possibly ramped-up conflict, the Kremlin-controlled lower of house of parliament voted Tuesday to toughen laws against desertion, surrender and looting by Russian troops. Lawmakers also voted to introduce possible 10-year prison terms for soldiers refusing to fight. If approved, as expected, by the upper house and then signed by Putin, the legislation would strengthen commanders’ hands against failing morale reported among soldiers.",
            "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there are no prospects for a diplomatic settlement. Medvedev, who served as Russia’s president from 2008-2012, said on his messaging app channel that separatist region votes are important to protect their residents and would “completely change” Russia’s future trajectory.",
            "“After they are held and the new territories are taken into Russia’s fold, a geopolitical transformation of the world will become irreversible,” Medvedev said.",
            "“An encroachment on the territory of Russia is a crime that would warrant any means of self-defense,” he said, adding that Russia would enshrine the new territories in its constitution so no future Russian leader could hand them back.",
            "“That is why they fear those referendums so much in Kyiv and in the West,” Medvedev said. “That is why they must be held.”",
            "Ukrainian analyst Volodymyr Fesenko, head of the independent Penta Center think-tank based in Kyiv, said the Kremlin hopes the votes and the possibility of military escalation will raise the pressure from Western governments for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to start talks with Moscow.",
            "The move “reflects the weakness, not the strength of the Kremlin, which is struggling to find levers to influence the situation that has increasingly spun out of its control,” he said.",
            "The recapturing of territory, most notably in the northeastern Kharkiv region, has strengthened Ukraine’s arguments that its troops could deliver more stinging defeats to Russia with additional armament deliveries.",
            "More heavy weaponry is on its way, with Slovenia promising 28 tanks and Germany pledging four additional self-propelled howitzers. More aid also is expected from Britain, already one of Ukraine’s biggest military backers after the U.S. British Prime Minister Liz Truss is expected to promise that in 2023, her government will “match or exceed” the 2.3 billion pounds ($2.7 billion) in military aid given to Ukraine this year.",
            "The swiftness of the Ukrainian counteroffensive also saw Russian forces abandon armored vehicles and other weapons as they beat hasty retreats. Ukrainian forces are recycling the captured weaponry back into battle. A Washington-based think tank, The Institute for the Study of War, said abandoned Russian T-72 tanks are being used by Ukrainian forces seeking to push into Russian-occupied Luhansk.",
            "In the counteroffensive’s wake, Ukrainian officials found hundreds of graves near the once-occupied city of Izium. Yevhenii Yenin, a deputy minister in Ukraine’s Internal Affairs Ministry, told a national telecast that officials found many bodies “with signs of violent death.”",
            "“These are broken ribs and broken heads, men with bound hands, broken jaws and severed genitalia,” he said.",
            "Meanwhile, Ukraine’s southern military command said its troops sank a Russian barge carrying troops and weapons across the Dnieper River near the Russian-occupied city of Nova Kakhovka. It offered no other details on the attack in the Russian-occupied Kherson region, which has been a major target in the Ukrainian counteroffensive.",
            "In other developments:",
            "— Ukraine’s presidential office said fresh shelling killed three civilians and injured 19 more in a 24-hour span.",
            "— Moscow has likely moved its Kilo-class submarines from their station on the Crimean Peninsula to southern Russia over fears about them being struck by long-range Ukrainian fire, the British military said.",
            "— McDonald’s restaurants in Kyiv began serving again for the first time since the invasion, offering only delivery service initially but marking a step of sorts back toward the life Ukrainians knew before the war.",

            "Forecasters said Fiona was expected to pass near Grand Turk, the British territory’s capital island, on Tuesday morning.",
            "“Storms are unpredictable,” Premier Washington Misick said in a statement from London, where he was attending the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II. “You must therefore take every precaution to ensure your safety.”",
            "Misick is scheduled to return home on Thursday.",
            "Early Tuesday, Fiona was centered 20 miles (30 kilometers) southeast of Grand Turk Island. It had maximum sustained winds of 115 mph (185 kph) and was moving north-northwest at 10 mph (17 kph).",
            "The intensifying storm kept dropping copious rain over the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, where a 58-year-old man died after police said he was swept away by a river in the central mountain town of Comerio.",
            "Another death was linked to a power blackout — a 70-year-old man was burned to death after he tried to fill his generator with gasoline while it was running, officials said.",
            "The National Guard has rescued more than 900 people as floodwaters continue to rush through towns in eastern and southern Puerto Rico with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain forecast for some areas. Multiple landslides also were reported.",
            "The blow from Fiona was made more devastating because Puerto Rico has yet to recover from Hurricane Maria, which killed nearly 3,000 people and destroyed the power grid in 2017. Five years later, more than 3,000 homes on the island are still covered by blue tarps.",
            "Authorities said at least 1,300 people and some 250 pets remain in shelters across the island.",
            "Fiona sparked a blackout when it hit Puerto Rico’s southwest corner on Sunday, the anniversary of Hurricane Hugo, which slammed into the island in 1989 as a Category 3 storm.",
            "By Tuesday morning, authorities said they had restored power to more than 260,000 customers on the island of 3.2 million people.",
            "Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi has warned it could take days before everyone has electricity.",
            "Water service was cut to more than 837,000 customers — two thirds of the total on the island — because of turbid water at filtration plants or lack of power, officials said.",
            "Fiona is not expected to threaten the U.S. mainland.",
            "In the Dominican Republic, authorities reported one death: a man hit by a falling tree. The storm displaced more than 12,400 people and cut off at least two communities.",
            "The hurricane left several highways blocked, and a tourist pier in the town of Miches was badly damaged by high waves. At least four international airports were closed, officials said.",
            "The Dominican president, Luis Abinader, said authorities would need several days to assess the storm’s effects.",
            "Fiona previously battered the eastern Caribbean, killing one man in the French territory of Guadeloupe when floodwaters washed his home away, officials said."

            "NEW YORK (AP) — After a year spent off-air, the Golden Globe Awards are returning to NBC in January, when the embattled Hollywood Foreign Press Association will seek a primetime comeback.",
            "NBC, the Hollywood Press Association and dick clark productions on Tuesday made the Globes’ return official. The 80th Golden Globes will be held January 10, airing both on NBC and Peacock.",
            "For the past year and half, Hollywood has effectively boycotted the Globes, for years one of the most-watched award shows after the Academy Awards. But after the Los Angeles Times reported ahead of the 2021 broadcast that the HFPA’s 87 members of non-American journalists included no Black members, studios, publicists and stars said they would cease participating in the Globes. Tom Cruise returned his three Golden Globe awards.",
            "Since then, the HFPA has reorganized itself, revamped its membership and enacted reforms designed to curtail the kinds of unethical behavior the group has long been criticized for. The HFPA added new members, including six Black voting members, and recently added 103 international, nonmember voters. The HFPA on Tuesday said their voting body is now 52% female, 19.5% Latino, 12% Asian, 10% Black and 10% Middle Eastern.",
            "“We recognize the HFPA’s commitment to ongoing change and look forward to welcoming back the Golden Globes to NBC for its landmark 80th Anniversary in January 2023,” said Frances Berwick, chairman of entertainment networks for NBCUniversal.",
            "NBC had reason to want to get the Globes back on the air. In 2018, the network signed an eight-year deal to continue airing the awards through 2026. Citing the HFPA’s ongoing reforms, NBC elected not to televise the previous Golden Globes in January. The organization went ahead announcing awards, anyway, in an untelevised and little-noticed gathering unattended by nominees.",
            "This year’s ceremony, the organizations said, will be broadcast in a one-year agreement. Terms were unavailable but the deal is expected to be less than the approximately $60 million the network previously paid annually to air the Globes. With backlash swirling and the ceremony scaled down because of the pandemic, the 2021 Globes were watched by 6.9 million people, according to Nielsen, down from more than 18 million the year before.",
            "Whether NBC’s endorsement will be enough to return the Globes to Hollywood’s good graces, however, remains to be seen. Nominations to the Globes will be announced Dec. 12.",
            "The HFPA is currently being run by interim Chief Executive Todd Boehly, whose investment firm, Eldridge Industries, bought the Globes and turned it from a nonprofit into a for-profit venture. Boehly’s firm is also the parent company of dick clark productions, the awards’ producer, and the owner of the Globes’ longtime home, the Beverly Hilton.",

            "BEIJING (AP) — President Joe Biden says U.S. forces would defend Taiwan if China tries to invade the self-ruled island claimed by Beijing as part of its territory, adding to displays of official American support for the island democracy.",
            "Biden said “yes” when asked during an interview broadcast Sunday on CBS News’s “60 Minutes” program whether “U.S. forces, U.S. men and women, would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.”",
            "CBS News reported the White House said after the interview U.S. policy hasn’t changed. That policy says Washington wants to see Taiwan’s status resolved peacefully but doesn’t say whether U.S. forces might be sent in response to a Chinese attack.",
            "Tension is rising following efforts by Chinese President Xi Jinping’s government to intimidate Taiwan by firing missiles into the nearby sea and flying fighter jets nearby and visits to Taipei by political figures including U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.",
            "Taiwan’s foreign ministry on Monday expressed “sincere gratitude” to Biden for “affirming the U.S. government’s rock-solid promise of security to Taiwan.”",
            "Taiwan will “resist authoritarian expansion and aggression” and “deepen the close security partnership” with Washington and other governments “with similar thinking” to protect regional stability, the statement said.",
            "Washington is obligated by federal law to see that Taiwan has the means to defend itself but doesn’t say whether U.S. forces would be sent. The United States has no formal relations with the island but maintains informal diplomatic ties.",
            "Taiwan and China split in 1949 after a civil war that ended with the Communist Party in control of the mainland. The two governments say they are one country but dispute which is entitled to be the national leader.",
            "Beijing criticizes official foreign contact with Taiwan’s elected government as encouragement to make its de facto independence permanent, a step the mainland says would lead to war.",
            "Washington says it doesn’t support formal independence for Taiwan, a stance Biden repeated in the interview broadcast Sunday.",
            "“Taiwan makes their own judgments about their independence,” the president said. “We’re not encouraging their being independent.”",
            "In May, Biden said “yes” when asked at a news conference in Tokyo whether he was willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan if China invaded.",

            "HAVANA (AP) — Hurricane Fiona bore down on the Dominican Republic Monday after knocking out the power grid and unleashing floods and landslides in Puerto Rico, where the governor said the damage was “catastrophic.”",
            "No deaths have been reported, but authorities in the U.S. territory said it was too early to estimate the damage from a storm that was still forecast to unleash torrential rain across Puerto Rico on Monday.",
            "Up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) was forecast for Puerto Rico’s eastern and southern regions.",
            "“It’s important people understand that this is not over,” said Ernesto Morales, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in San Juan.",
            "He said flooding has reached “historic levels,” with authorities evacuating or rescuing hundreds of people across the island.",
            "“The damages that we are seeing are catastrophic,” said Gov. Pedro Pierluisi.",
            "Brown water rushed through streets, into homes and even consumed a runway airport in southern Puerto Rico.",
            "Fiona also ripped up asphalt from roads and washed away a bridge in the central mountain town of Utuado that police say was installed by the National Guard after Hurricane Maria hit in 2017 as a Category 4 storm.",
            "The storm also ripped off the roofs of several homes, including that of Nelson Cirino in the northern coastal town of Loiza.",
            "“I was sleeping and saw when the corrugated metal flew off,” he said as he observed how the rain drenched his belonging.",
            "Ada Vivian Román, a 21-year-old photography student, said the storm knocked down trees and fences in her hometown of Toa Alta.",
            "“I’m actually very anxious because it’s a really slow-moving hurricane,” she said.",
            "She said she is also worried about whether the public transportation she relies on to get to her job at a public relations agency will be operating by the time she has to go back to the office.",
            "“But I know that I’m privileged compared with other families who are practically losing their homes because they are under water,” she said.",
            "Fiona was centered 50 miles (85 kilometers) southeast of Punta Cana, Dominican Republic with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (140 kph) on Sunday night, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. It was moving to the northwest at 9 mph (15 kph).",
            "It hit on the anniversary of Hurricane Hugo, which slammed into the island in 1989 as a Category 3 storm.",
            "As authorities continue to assess the damage from Fiona, many wondered when power would be restored.",
            "“That’s probably the worst damage there is,” said Tomás Rivera, who co-owns a hotel in the southwest coastal town of El Combate.",
            "U.S. President Joe Biden declared a state of emergency in the U.S. territory as the eye of the storm approached the island’s southwest corner.",
            "The blackout that Hurricane Maria caused was blamed for the deaths of nearly 3,000 people in the storm’s sweltering aftermath, with power in some neighborhoods not restored until a year later. Maria was a devastating Category 4 storm that struck on Sept. 20, 2017.",
            "Luma, the company that operates power transmission and distribution, said bad weather, including winds of 80 mph, had disrupted transmission lines on Sunday, leading to “a blackout on all the island.”",
            "Health centers were running on generators — and some of those had failed. Health Secretary Carlos Mellado said crews rushed to repair generators at the Comprehensive Cancer Center, where several patients had to be evacuated.",
            "More than 3,000 homes still have only a blue tarp as a roof, and infrastructure remains weak, including the power grid. Outages remain common, and reconstruction started only recently.",
            "“I think all of us Puerto Ricans who lived through Maria have that post-traumatic stress of, ‘What is going to happen, how long is it going to last and what needs might we face?’” said Danny Hernández, who works in the capital of San Juan but planned to weather the storm with his parents and family in the western town of Mayaguez.",
            "The storm pummeled cities and towns along Puerto Rico’s southern coast that have not yet fully recovered from a string of strong earthquakes starting in late 2019.",
            "More than 1,000 people with some 80 pets had sought shelter across the island by Sunday night, the majority of them in the southern coast.",
            "Fiona was forecast to swipe the Dominican Republic early Monday and then northern Haiti and the Turks and Caicos Islands with the threat of heavy rain. It could threaten the far southern end of the Bahamas on Tuesday.",
            "Hurricane warnings were posted for the Dominican Republic’s eastern coast from Cabo Caucedo to Cabo Frances Viejo, and for the Turks and Caicos.",
            "Fiona previously battered the eastern Caribbean, killing one man in the French territory of Guadeloupe when floods washed his home away, officials said."

That crash was blamed on aged plane components, high speed and undocumented and untested modifications that had been made to the aircraft.",

            "SILVER SPRING, Md. — For some, it’s hearing air raid sirens while talking with relatives back in Ukraine. For others, it’s the fear that Ukraine may become an economic basket case, even if it wins the war. Or that the world may forget the country’s plight altogether.",
            "Ukrainans, their friends and those simply curious about the country that’s fought Russia to standstill gathered on a sun-splashed weekend at St. Andrew Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral in suburban Washington for the region’s biggest annual Ukrainian cultural festival.",
            "Amid women wearing garlands in their hair, men wearing vyshyvanka — white shirts with intricately patterned embroidery down the front — and accompanied by traditional and pop Ukrainian music, the war was never far from people’s minds. What in past years had been a chance to showcase the culture and drink some beers from the home country had taken on a different, somewhat deeper meaning.",
            "“This year is particularly beautiful and sad at the same time,” said the church pastor, the Rev. Volodymr Steliac, as he formally opened the festival Saturday.",
            "“We have seen the worst of humanity but at the same time we have seen the best of humanity.”",
            "The festival opened on Day 206 of the invasion and came amid good news for Ukraine: a surprise counteroffensive in the northeast that in a few days cleared Russians from towns and villages they had fought weeks to take earlier in the war.",
            "But the victory came with a price. In the strategic town of Izium, mass graves were found, similar to those seen in the capital Kyiv’s suburb of Bucha when the war began.",
            "Oksana Sukhina, who was staffing the booth of the U.S. Ukraine Foundation, where she is project director, said she wanted to see what the impact of the latest reports of atrocities will be on Europe.",
            "In the past, she said, some people suspected Ukrainians have exaggerated the cruelty of the Russians with reports of horrific claims like rape as a weapon of war and the theft of household goods then shipped to Russia.",
            "“Then you see Bucha, you see now Izyum. And we have yet to see Kherson and Mariupol and other places,” Sukhina said.",
            "Sukhina, 50, immigrated to the U.S. from Kyiv in 2020. Warned by former colleagues in the State Department about the likelihood of invasion, her parents arrived in Washington only days before the war.",
            "But as the prospect of Kyiv’s being captured receded, they went back, as did one of her daughters. They joined a 23-year-old son who left his IT job in Chicago in March to help deliver food and medical supplies in Kyiv.",
            "Sukhina said she tried to convince him to stay, but could not forbid him to leave because she had participated in pro-democracy protests in 2004 and 2014.",
            "“I’m proud of them. They are trying to do whatever they can. And this is what makes us win,” she said.",
            "Steliac said the church was open 24-7 when the war began. He was only getting two or three hours of sleep a night as volunteers dropped off humanitarian aid, organized it and shipped it to Ukraine.",
            "In one 48-hour period, he said, two of those young volunteers lost their fathers back in Ukraine.",
            "“The war is not there alone; the war is here as well,” Steliac said.",
            "Even though the process of gathering and sending aid has become more routine, even keeping in touch with family back home, he said, can be painful.",
            "“What was traumatic was that they were communicating with their relatives and they said, ‘Oh, a bomb fell just a couple of neighborhoods over’ and then they tried to connect again and the phone connection doesn’t go through,” Steliac said.",
            "“You think of the worst.”",
            "Alex Naumovych, a 36-year old mortgage loan officer from Ternopil in the western part of Ukraine, said he’s had calls interrupted by the air raid sirens, although now he said the alarms are likely to be ignored.",
            "Ternopil, a city of about 250,000, has no military targets, but he said his parents still hear the sirens daily. Ukraine tracks incoming missiles and activates local warning systems based on where they could potentially land, so even residents of cities not targeted are warned.",
            "“I’m worried that, sooner or later, one of those missiles may hit my city, like my parents’ place,” Naumovych said.",
            "Naumovych arrived in the U.S. almost 11 years ago. He had about $440 to his name then, he said, and started a landscaping business he sold years later for more than $1 million.",
            "“I love this country. Like you can come with $400 and six, seven years later you can be a millionaire,” he said.",
            "One of his big worries for Ukraine now is its economy, with so many people out of work because of the war and inflation projected to hit 30%.",
            "“The economy is in bad shape,” Naumovych said. “A lot of people left Ukraine and I’m not sure they’re coming back”",
            "The parents of software engineer Serhiy Vorobiov, 43, are near the war’s front line in Zaporizhzhya, a Russian-speaking region that includes Europe’s largest nuclear power plant. Russia has captured the plant and Ukrainians and others fear they will use it for blackmail.",
            "But Vorobiov said his parents, only 25 miles from the front lines in the city of Zaporizhzhya, still think everything is relatively safe. He said he chats with them with about the same frequency as before the war.",
            "“Maybe because there is no very high emergency at this point. I know it’s not to my defense, but that’s how it is,” he said.",
            "Vorobiov, his wife Oksana, 33, and their three young children, Yaromyr, Myroslava and Oksana, have lived in the U.S. since 2020. He said the war has reinforced his belief in getting rid of any Russian influence on their upbringing.",
            "“I always dreamed of it, I just didn’t want to be very tough in that. But now I have all the rights and I want to use it,” Vorobiov said.",
            "“I want them to forget [the] Russian language. We are from [the] Russian-speaking part of Ukraine, but now we are fixing it, as much as we can. Forget Russian, forget we were ever together, [forget] Soviet Union. I’m happy they don’t know what Soviet Union is.”",
            "But in her remarks to open the festivities, Oksana Markarova, the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, advised focusing on the present, not the past.",
            "“Please be joyful today,” she counseled.",
            "She said Russian leader Vladimir Putin and the Russians want Ukrainians to “sit down and cry” at the devastation.",

            "WASHINGTON (AP) — An American contractor held hostage in Afghanistan for more than two years by the Taliban has been released, his family said Monday, as a Taliban drug lord jailed by the United States was also freed and returned to Kabul.",
            "Mark Frerichs, a Navy veteran who had spent more than a decade in Afghanistan as a civilian contractor, was abducted in January 2020 and was believed to have been since then by the Taliban-linked Haqqani network.",
            "Negotiations for his release had centered on a deal that would also involve the release of Bashir Noorzai, a notorious drug lord and member of the Taliban who told reporters in Kabul on Monday that he spent 17 years and six months in U.S. captivity",
            "The Biden administration did not immediately confirm details of the prisoner swap, but a sister of Frerichs, who is from Lombard, Illinois, thanked U.S. government officials who helped secure her brother’s release.",
            "“I am so happy to hear that my brother is safe and on his way home to us. Our family has prayed for this each day of the more than 31 months he has been a hostage. We never gave up hope that he would survive and come home safely to us,” said a statement from the sister, Charlene Cakora.",
            "In Afghanistan, Noorzai told reporters at a press conference that he had been released from an unspecified U.S. prison and handed over earlier in the day to the Taliban in Kabul, in exchange for an American prisoner held in Afghanistan whom he did not identify.",
            "Other Taliban officials claimed Noorzai was held at the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, but did not offer say anything to support that claim.",
            "The Taliban-appointed foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, also spoke at the press conference alongside Noorzai and welcomed the exchange, saying it marked the start of a “new era” in U.S.-Taliban relations.",
            "Frerichs, abducted on Jan. 31, 2020, was last seen in a video distributed earlier this year, pleading for his release so that he can be reunited with his family, according to a recording posted by The New Yorker magazine at the time.",
            "“This can be a new chapter between Afghanistan and the United States, this can open a new door for talks between both countries,” Muttaqi said at the Kabul presser.",
            "“This act shows us that all problems can be solved through talks and I thank both sides’ teams who worked so hard for this to happen,” Muttaqi added.",
            "Frerichs, of Lombard, Illinois, was believed to be held by the Taliban-affiliated Haqqani network, and U.S. officials across two presidential administrations had tried unsuccessfully to get him home. In the video, which marked the first time Frerichs was seen since his abduction, he says it was filmed last November.",
            "Videos of hostages are sometimes released to show proof that they are alive and to facilitate negotiations for a release, though it was not immediately clear if that was the case here. The New Yorker said it obtained the clip from an unidentified individual in Afghanistan.",
            "At the time, the FBI declined to comment on the video’s authenticity, but a sister of Frerichs, Charlene Cakora, issued a statement thanking the Taliban for releasing the video and describing it as “public confirmation of our family’s long-held belief that he is alive after more than two years in captivity.”",
            "Since their takeover of Afghanistan in August last year, the Taliban have demanded the United States release Noorzai in exchange for Frerichs amid expectations of such exchanges for U.S. citizens held in Afghanistan.",
            "However, there has been no public sign of Washington moving forward on any sort of prisoner trade or exchange.",
            "The Taliban also posted a brief video Monday on social media showing Noorzai’s arrival at the Kabul airport where he was welcomed by top Taliban officials, including Muttaqi.",
            "At the press conference, Noorzai expressed thankfulness at seeing his “mujahedeen brothers” — a reference to the Taliban — in Kabul.",
            "“I pray for more success of the Taliban,” he added. “I hope this exchange can lead to peace between Afghanistan and America, because an American was released and I am also free now.”",

            "Chelsea Gray scored 20 points to lead the Las Vegas Aces to their first WNBA title, and the city’s first pro title, in a 78-71 road win over the Connecticut Sun in Game 4.",
            "Gray went 9 of 13 from the floor, and was named Finals MVP after averaging 18.3 points in the series.",
            "Vegas finished on an 8-0 run. As the buzzer sounded, league MVP A’ja Wilson, who played every minute of the game, grabbed the ball and stomped the floor before being mobbed by her teammates.",
            "“We champs! We champs! We champs!” Wilson screamed at teammates as they pulled on their championship hats and T-shirts before the trophy ceremony.",
            "Riquna Williams had 17 points for Vegas, Kelsey Plum added 16 points, Jackie Young had 13 and Wilson added 11 points to go with her 14 rebounds.",
            "Wilson hopes this is just the beginning for the franchise.",
            "“You see it. You see it,” Wilson said in the on-court celebration. “This is what we’re building. This is what we’re doing. This is it. I’m so happy right now.”",
            "Courtney Williams had 17 points to lead Connecticut and Alyssa Thomas had her second straight triple-double with 11 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds. Jonquel Jones added 13 points and DeWanna Bonner had 12.",
            "“When you come up short it certainly, really hurts,” Sun coach Curt Miller said. “But that means that there was something that mattered, and something special among that group of players.”",
            "For Aces coach Becky Hammon, who didn’t get a title in her standout WNBA career, the ring completed a decades-long quest. She left an assistant coach position with Gregg Popovich and the San Antonio Spurs to take over in Las Vegas. The move paid off.",
            "“They’re unbelievable on the court, but they’re unbelievable humans, first and foremost,” Hammon said. “They care about each other. They invest in each other. It’s been an absolute honor to be their coach. I saw excellence and I wanted to be a part of it.”",
            "Hammon also paid tribute to former Aces coach Bill Laimbeer, who was on the floor for the ceremony: “He put this team together and saw the pieces.”",
            "Aces owner Mark Davis, who also owns the NFL’s Las Vegas Raiders, wasn’t with his football team Sunday. He was in Connecticut to get a trophy. He hoisted it, then turned it over to gleeful players who did the same.",
            "“Las Vegas, we are world champions,” Davis said.",
            "The Aces led by two points at the half and four points after three quarters. They held a six-point lead in the fourth when Plum was called for a flagrant foul after running into Bonner while the Sun guard was attempting a 3-pointer and sending her to the floor holding her right ankle.",
            "Bonner hit all three free throws before Jones’ short jumper cut the lead to a point. The Sun then tied the game at 67 on free throw by Courtney Williams and took a 71-70 lead on two fouls shots from Brionna Jones.",
            "But Las Vegas had the answers.",
            "Riquna Williams 3-pointer put the Aces back on top and Gray’s step-back jumper extended the lead back to 75-71 with under a minute left. A’ja Wilson then stole a pass and Plum hit a short jump shot to secure the win.",
            "SCRAPPY GAME",
            "As expected, it was a physical game — appropriately played on an NFL Sunday. The Sun got a scare when Bonner took an inadvertent elbow to the gut from Gray late in the first quarter and was on the floor for a few minutes before being helped to the bench. She came back into the game later in the half, apparently suffering no ill effects. Natisha Hiedeman and Plum got into a short pushing match in the second quarter, eliciting technical fouls for both players. That was all before Plum’s flagrant in the fourth.",
            "NO GRAY AREA",
            "Gray wasn’t a WNBA All-Star this season, nor was she a first-team all-league pick, and had voiced her displeasure about that. After scoring 21 points in each of the first two games of the Finals, she scored just 11 points in Game 3, but bounced back. Way back.",
            "“They can keep that All-Star and first team,” Gray said. “I got the ring.”",
            "INCLUSIVE ORGANIZATIONS",
            "Before the game, both coaches reflected on the makeup of organizations in the Final. The Aces are led by Hammon and two Black women executives in general manager Natalie Williams and Nikki Fargas, president of business operations. The Sun are owned by the Mohegan Tribe, have a woman president in Jen Rizzotti and are coached by Curt Miller, a gay man.",
            "“Women’s basketball is such a story in terms of diversity and inclusion. I mean, our league defines it and I’m so proud to be a part of it,” Miller said, adding that he hopes to be an inspiration to any gay child “wondering if they can chase a career in sports.”",
            "Hammon said she believes the diversity in her team’s front office has made it stronger.",

            "LONDON (AP) — U.S. President Joe Biden paid his respects at Queen Elizabeth II’s coffin on Sunday as thousands of police, hundreds of British troops and an army of officials made final preparations for the queen’s state funeral — a spectacular display of national mourning that will also be the biggest gathering of world leaders for years.",
            "People across Britain paused for a minute of silence at 8 p.m. in memory of the only monarch most have ever known. At Westminster Hall, where the queen is lying in state, the constant stream of mourners paused for 60 seconds as people observed the minute of reflection in deep silence.",
            "In Windsor, where the queen will be laid to rest on Monday after her funeral at Westminster Abbey, rain began to fall as the crowd fell silent for the moment of reflection. The rain stopped as the crowd erupted in applause.",
            "Biden and first lady Jill Biden were among thousands of mourners — from locals and tourists to royals and world leaders — to pay their respects. The president made the sign of the cross and put his hand to his heart as he stood quietly near the casket in the ornate 900-year-old hall with his wife and U.S. Ambassador Jane Hartley.",
            "Biden then signed the official condolence book and attended a reception Sunday at Buckingham Palace hosted by King Charles III. He is one of 500 world leaders and royals invited to the queen’s state funeral Monday, along with hundreds of dignitaries, politicians, military veterans and British charity workers.",
            "Biden called Queen Elizabeth II “decent” and “honorable” and “all about service” as he signed the condolence book, saying his heart went out to the royal family.",
            "“Queen Elizabeth lived her life for the people,” Jill Biden wrote in a book for spouses and ambassadors. “She served with wisdom and grace. We will never forget her warmth, kindness and the conversations we shared.”",
            "As the dignitaries poured in, the clock was ticking down for those seeking a place in the longest queue many have ever seen to file past the queen’s coffin. The miles-long queue is expected to be closed to new arrivals later Sunday so that everyone now in the line can view the coffin before Monday morning, when it will be taken to Westminster Abbey for the queen’s funeral.",
            "Family by family, thousands of people kept joining the line around the clock, braving chilly overnight temperatures and waits of up to 17 hours in a queue that stretched for over 5 miles (8 kilometers).",
            "Lauren Wilson, 36, was in the much-shorter queue for people with mobility issues. She said she wanted to experience in person the coffin lying in state.",
            "“The world is in such a weird place and then this happened. It feels more momentous,” she said.",
            "She worried that the pageantry surrounding Elizabeth’s death deprives the queen’s relatives of the ability to come to terms with their loss.",
            "“The family are not allowed to grieve. I find it quite heartbreaking,” she said.",
            "The queen’s eight grandchildren, led by heir to the throne Prince William, circled the coffin and stood with their heads bowed during a silent vigil on Saturday evening.",
            "Among the foreign leaders in London was New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who told the BBC she was humbled to represent her nation at the funeral and to witness the national outpouring of grief and respect for the late queen.",
            "“The thing that I will take away from this period is just the beauty of the public’s response, the kindness that you see from members of the public, the patience, the camaraderie. That has been, for me, the most moving tribute of all, has been the public response of the British people,” she said.",
            "People across the U.K. will also pause Sunday evening for a nationwide minute of silence to remember the queen, who died Sept. 8 at 96 after 70 years on the throne. Monday has been declared a public holiday, and the funeral will be broadcast to a huge television audience worldwide and screened to crowds in parks and public spaces across the country.",
            "Police officers from around the country will be on duty as part of the biggest one-day policing operation in London’s history.",
            "Crowds also gathered Sunday near Windsor Castle, where the queen will be laid to rest at a private family ceremony on Monday evening.",
            "Steve Beeson came with his family of three and a bouquet of flowers he had purchased for the queen.",
            "“She has been a constant steadying of the reins for the country through all of these really rough times, the least we can do is come and say ‘Thank you,’” he said.",
            "Camilla, the queen consort, paid tribute to her mother-in-law in a video message, saying the monarch “carved her own role” as a “solitary woman” on a world stage dominated by men.",
            "“I will always remember her smile. That smile is unforgettable,” said Camilla, who is married to Charles.",
            "Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, was also among mourners paying respects to the queen’s coffin. British royal officials said Zelenska met with Catherine, the Princess of Wales, at Buckingham Palace on Sunday afternoon. They did not release further details. The British government has been among the strongest supporters of Ukraine since it was invaded by Russia in February.",
            "On Saturday night, it was the grandchildren’s time to mourn. William and Prince Harry, Charles’ sons, were joined by Princess Anne’s children, Zara Tindall and Peter Philips; Prince Andrew’s daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie; and Prince Edward’s two children — Lady Louise Windsor and James, Viscount Severn.",
            "William stood with his head bowed at the head of the coffin and Harry at the foot. Both princes, who are military veterans, were in uniform. The crowd kept slowly, silently filing past.",
            "“You could see that they were thinking hard about their grandmother, the queen,” said Ian Mockett, a civil engineer from Oxford in southern England. “It was good to see them all together as a set of grandchildren, given the things that have happened over the last few years.”",
            "The lying-in-state continues until early Monday morning, when the queen’s coffin will be moved on a gun carriage pulled by 142 Royal Navy sailors to nearby Westminster Abbey for the funeral, the finale of 10 days of national mourning for Britain’s longest-reigning monarch.",
            "After the service Monday at the abbey, the late queen’s coffin will be transported through the historic heart of London on the state gun carriage. It will then be taken in a hearse to Windsor, where the queen will be interred alongside her late husband, Prince Philip, who died last year at 99.",
            "Sumita Tanda put down bright red roses as a huge floral tribute bloomed near Windsor Castle.",
            "“I feel so privileged to be a local resident of Windsor,” she said. “I just wanted to pay my respects.”",

            "Cameron, whose epic adventure movie is the highest-grossing film of all time, told The New York Times on Friday that the creative process behind the film didn’t come without a fight.",
            "Cameron — who did not refer to the studio by name — said studio executives thought the epic film “should be shorter” and characters were flying around too much on banshee creatures.",

            "The director, who told The Times that “Avatar” is “still competitive with everything that’s out there these days,” claimed the studio later thanked him for his pushback.",

            "Cameron’s reflections on the blockbuster arrived roughly three months before the scheduled release of its sequel — “Avatar: The Way of Water” — on Dec. 16.",
            "The sequel arrives 13 years after the original film, a wait that Cameron said once left him a “little concerned” ahead of December.",
            "“I was a little concerned that I had stretched the tether too far, in our fast-paced, modern world ... [right] until we dropped the teaser trailer and we got 148 million views in 24 hours,” Cameron told The Times.",
            "“There’s that scarce seen but wondered at principle, which is, Wow, we haven’t seen that in a long time, but I remember how cool it was back then. Does that play in our favor? I don’t know. I guess we’re going to find out.”"

            "“It’s a loss that leaves a giant hole and sometimes you think you’ll never overcome it,” said Biden, who often talks in very personal terms about loss following the death of his first wife and young daughter and later, his adult son.",
            "The president and first lady Jill Biden have kept a low profile since landing in the United Kingdom. They traveled to Westminster Hall to pay their respects along with hundreds of thousands of mourners who waited more than 14 hours to walk past the queen’s casket.",
            "Biden and the first lady then went to Lancaster House to sign the condolence book before heading to Buckingham Palace for a reception hosted by King Charles III.",
            "The president spoke briefly after he signed the condolence book. “As I’ve told the king, she’s going to be with him every step of the way,” Biden said. “You were fortunate to have had her for 70 years. We all were.”",

            "Some census takers who falsified information during the 2020 count didn’t have their work redone fully, weren’t fired in a timely manner and in some cases even received bonuses, according to the U.S. Commerce Department’s watchdog group.",
            "The findings released Friday by the Office of Inspector General raise concerns about possible damage to the quality of the once-a-decade head count that determines political power and federal funding,",
            "Off-campus students at colleges and universities were likely undercounted since the census started around the same time students were sent home to stop the spread of COVID-19 in March 2020, the review found.",
            "During the 2020 census, The Associated Press documented cases of census takers who were pressured by their supervisors to enter false information into a computer system about homes they had not visited so they could close cases during the waning days of the census.",
            "Supervisors were able to track their census takers’ work in real time through mobile devices that the census takers used to record information about households’ numbers, demographic characteristics and members’ relationships to one another. As a result, supervisors would get alerts when actions raised red flags about accuracy, such as a census taker recording data on a home while far away from the address or a census taker conducting an interview in just a few minutes. As a quality control check, others census takers were sent back to homes to re-interview residents.",
            "The Inspector General’s probe concluded that some alerts weren’t being properly resolved, some re-interviews weren’t properly conducted and that the work of some census takers whose work had been flagged for falsifying data had not been reworked to fix its accuracy. In fact, some census takers whose work was flagged for falsifications were given more cases, weren’t fired and were reassigned to other operations, the report said.",
            "Of the 1,400 census takers who were designated “hard fails” because questions about the accuracy of their work, only 300 were fired for misconduct or unsatisfactory performance. Of the 1,400 “hard fail” census takers, 1,300 of them received bonuses ranging from $50 to $1,600 each, the report said.",
            "The census is the largest nonmilitary mobilization in the U.S. Data gathered during the census determines how many congressional seats each state gets. The numbers also are used for redrawing political districts and distributing $1.5 trillion in federal spending each year. Because of that, undercounts can cost communities funding.",
            "The 2020 census faced unprecedented challenges including the pandemic, natural disasters and political interference from the Trump administration.",
            "In response to the Inspector General’s report, the Census Bureau said it appreciated the concerns that were raised but disagreed with the conclusions that data quality may have been damaged since the report cited only a small number of cases out of the overall workload.",
            "“As a result, we asserted that the findings could not and should not be presented as a conclusive assessment of overall census quality,” Census Bureau Director Robert Santos said in the written response.",
            "Under Census Bureau rules, college and university students should have been counted where they spent the most time, either at on-campus housing or off-campus apartments, even if they were sent home because of the pandemic. Most schools didn’t provide the Census Bureau with off-campus student data, and the bureau had to use a last-resort, less-accurate statistical tool to fill in the information gaps on more than 10% of the off-campus student population when they were given the information, the Inspector General’s report said.",
            "Schools often didn’t provide the data because they didn’t information on off-campus students or because of privacy concerns. The Inspector General recommends passage of legislation that would require schools to provide needed information in future head counts.",
            "“Although difficult to quantify, the fiscal implication of specifically undercounting off-campus students at the correct location for states and localities is potentially far-reaching,” the report said.",
            "The city of Boston, which is home to Northeastern University, Boston University and several other schools, said in a challenge to its census figures that the count missed 6,000 students."

            "A first-of-its-kind database for tracking the world’s fossil fuel production, reserves and emissions launches on Monday to coincide with climate talks taking place at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.",
            "The Global Registry of Fossil Fuels includes data from over 50,000 oil, gas and coal fields in 89 countries. That covers 75% of global reserves, production and emissions, and is available for public use, a first for a collection of this size.",
            "Until now there has been private data available for purchase, and analysis of the world’s fossil fuel usage and reserves. The International Energy Agency also maintains public data on oil, gas and coal, but it focuses on the demand for those fossil fuels, whereas this new database looks at what is yet to be burned.",
            "The registry was developed by Carbon Tracker, a nonprofit think tank that researches the energy transition’s effect on financial markets, and the Global Energy Monitor, an organization that tracks a variety of energy projects around the globe.",
            "Corporations, investors and scientists already have some level of access to private data on fossil fuels. Mark Campanale, founder of Carbon Tracker, said he hopes the registry will empower groups to hold governments accountable, for example, when they issue licenses for fossil fuel extraction.",
            "“Civil society groups have got to get more of a focus on what governments are planning to do in terms of license issuance, both for coal and oil and gas, and actually begin to challenge this permitting process,” Campanale told The Associated Press.",
            "The release of the database and an accompanying analysis of the collected data coincide with two critical sets of climate talks at the international level — the U.N. General Assembly in New York beginning on September 13, and COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, in November. Data like what’s being released in the registry could arm environmental and climate groups to pressure national leaders to agree to stronger policies that result in less carbon emissions.",
            "And we’re in dire need of carbon reductions, Campanale said.",
            "In their analysis of the data, the developers found that the United States and Russia have enough fossil fuel still underground untapped to exhaust the world’s remaining carbon budget. That’s the remaining carbon the world can afford to emit before a certain amount of warming occurs, in this case 1.5 degrees Celsius. It also shows these reserves would generate 3.5 trillion tons of greenhouse gas emissions, which is more than all of the emissions produced since the Industrial Revolution.",
            "“We already have enough extractable fossil fuels to cook the planet. We can’t afford to use them all — or almost any of them at this point. We’ve run out of time to build new things in old ways,” said Rob Jackson, a Stanford University climate scientist who was not involved with the database.",
            "“I like the emphasis on transparency in fossil fuel production and reserves, down to specific projects. That’s a unique aspect to the work.”",
            "Jackson compared the global carbon budget to a bathtub.",
            "“You can run water only so long before the tub overflows,” he said. When the tub is close to overflowing, he said, governments can turn down the faucet (mitigating greenhouse gas emissions) or open the tub’s drain more (removing carbon from the atmosphere).",
            "The database shows that we have much more carbon than we need as a global community, Campanale said, and more than enough to overflow the bathtub and flood the bathroom in Jackson’s analogy. So investors and shareholders should be holding decision makers at the world’s largest oil, gas and coal companies accountable when they approve new investments in fossil fuel extraction, he said.",
            "Campanale said the hope is the investment community, “who ultimately own these corporations,” will use the data to begin to challenge the investment plans of companies still planning to expand oil, gas and coal projects.",
            "“Companies like Shell and Exxon, Chevron and their shareholders can use the analysis to to really begin to try and push the companies to move in a completely different direction.”",

            "JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — Residents on Alaska’s vast and sparsely populated western coast braced Friday for a powerful storm that forecasters said could be one of the worst in recent history, threatening hurricane-force winds and high surf that could knock out power and cause flooding.",
            "The storm is the remnants of what was Typhoon Merbok, which University of Alaska Fairbanks climate specialist Rick Thoman said is also influencing weather patterns far from Alaska — a rare late-summer storm now is expected to bring rain this weekend to drought-stricken parts of California.",
            "“All this warm air that’s been brought north by this ex-typhoon is basically inducing a chain reaction in the jet stream downstream from Alaska,” he said.",
            "“It’s a historic-level storm,” Thoman said of the system steaming toward Alaska. “In 10 years, people will be referring to the September 2022 storm as a benchmark storm.”",
            "Hurricane-force winds were forecast in parts of the Bering Sea, while in the small communities of Elim and Koyuk, around 90 miles (145 kilometers) from the hub community of Nome, water levels could be up to 18 feet (5 meters) above the normal high tide line, according to the National Weather Service. Flood warnings were in effect until Monday in parts of northwest Alaska.",
            "In Nome, which has about 3,500 residents, Leon Boardway was working as usual Friday at the Nome Visitors Center, a half-block from the Bering Sea. “I just want to keep my door open and the coffee pot on,” he said after it had begun to rain and the winds picked up.",
            "But few people were coming by. Residents, visitors and businesses in the town, famous for being at the end of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race and the setting for the dredging-for-gold reality show “Bering Sea Gold,” were boarding up windows and otherwise bracing for the storm.",
            "“The ocean is getting worse out there,” said Boardway, 71, as he checked out the center’s webcam, which from its high perch has a good view of the swells.",

            "The storm was located 145 miles (230 kilometers) southeast of St. Croix Saturday morning with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 kph). It was moving west at 13 mph (20 kph) on a path forecast to pass near Puerto Rico. Forecasters warned Fiona could be near hurricane strength when it passes through Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.",
            "Fiona is expected to swipe past the Dominican Republic on Sunday as a potential hurricane and Haiti and the Turks and Caicos Islands on Monday and Tuesday with the threat of extreme rain.",
            "Forecaster issued a hurricane watch for the southern coast of the Dominican Republic from Cabo Engaño westward to Cabo Caucedo and for the northern coast from Cabo Engaño westward to Puerto Plata.",

            "“It’s time to activate your emergency plan and contact and help your relatives, especially elderly adults who live alone,” said Dr. Gloria Amador, who runs a nonprofit health organization in central Puerto Rico.",
            "At least one cruise ship visit and several flights to the island were canceled, while authorities in the eastern Caribbean islands canceled school and prohibited people from practicing aquatic sports as Fiona battered the region.",
            "In the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, authorities said they recorded wind gusts of up to 74 mph (120 kph), which would be considered a Category 1 hurricane. They also said 9 inches (23 centimeters) of rain fell in three hours in the Gros Morne area.",
            "Fiona, which is the Atlantic hurricane season’s sixth named storm, was predicted to bring 5 to 10 inches (13 to 25 centimeters) of rain in eastern and southern Puerto Rico, with as much as 16 inches (41 centimeters) in isolated spots.

            "ISLAMABAD (AP) — The World Health Organization raised the alarm Saturday about a “second disaster\" in the wake of the deadly floods in Pakistan this summer, as doctors and medical workers on the ground race to battle outbreaks of waterborne and other diseases.",
            "The floodwaters started receding this week in the worst-hit provinces but many of the displaced — now living in tents and makeshift camps — increasingly face the threat of gastrointestinal infections, dengue fever and malaria, which are on the rise. The dirty and stagnant waters have become breeding grounds for mosquitos.",
            "The unprecedented monsoon rains since mid-June, which many experts link to climate change, and subsequent flooding have killed 1,545 people across Pakistan, inundated millions of acres of land and affected 33 million people. As many as 552 children have also been killed in the floods.",
            "“I am deeply concerned about the potential for a second disaster in Pakistan: a wave of disease and death following this catastrophe, linked to climate change, that has severely impacted vital health systems leaving millions vulnerable,\" WHO's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said in a statement.",
            "“The water supply is disrupted, forcing people to drink unsafe water,\" he said. “But if we act quickly to protect health and deliver essential health services, we can significantly reduce the impact of this impending crisis.\"",
            "The WHO chief also said that nearly 2,000 health facilities have been fully or partially damaged in Pakistan and urged donors to continue to respond generously so that more lives can be saved.",
            "Pakistani Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif left for New York on Saturday to attend the first fully in-person gathering of world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly since the coronavirus pandemic. Sharif will appeal for more help from the international community to tackle the disaster.",
            "Before his departure, Sharif urged philanthropists and aid agencies to donate baby food for children, along with blankets, clothes and other food items for the flood victims, saying they were desperately waiting for aid.",
            "The southern Sindh and southwestern Baluchistan provinces have been the worst hit — hundreds of thousands in Sindh live now in makeshift homes and authorities say it will take months to completely drain the water in the province.",
            "Nationwide, floods have damaged 1.8 million homes, washed away roads and destroyed nearly 400 bridges, according to the National Disaster Management Authority.",
            "Imran Baluch, head of a government-run district hospital in Jafferabad, in the district of Dera Allah Yar in Baluchistan, said that out of 300 people tested daily, nearly 70% are positive for malaria.",
            "After malaria, typhoid fever and skin infections are most commonly seen among the displaced, living for weeks in unhygienic conditions, Baluch told The Associated Press.",

            "After heavy rains flooded its main water plant roughly two weeks ago, Jackson, Mississippi, has been in a public health emergency. For one week, the city’s 150,000 residents had no water coming out of their taps. Residents lined up in hours-long lines for drive-through bottled water sites, nonprofits delivered to people who didn’t have the means to travel and schools went virtual.",
            "In 2021, after a historic winter storm forced the city’s main water plant to shut down, Jacksonians went without water for a month. Since then, the city has been dealing with a cycle of boil water notices. Those directives were issued due to the risk of contamination because of low water pressure.",
            "When the water was turned back on, residents still needed to boil their water before drinking or bathing. Videos of coffee-colored water coming out of Jackson’s taps went viral.",
            "But the city’s water crisis didn’t start with the latest storm — the public utility has been plagued with problems for the last three decades. And officials know it will happen again.",
            "“Without critical and very important capital improvements to be made of our water treatment facility, it’s not a matter of if it will fail again, but a matter of when it will fail again,” Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said on NPR last week.",
            "It’s going to take massive investments from the state and federal government to finally end the cycles of boil water notices and water system failures. Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves (R) has floated the idea of turning over the city’s utility to a private company, but privatization of public goods has long been derided by experts.",
            "“Privatization is on the table,” Reeves said earlier this month. “I’m open to ideas.”",
            "Jackson, which is 80% Black, has already attempted to partner with a private company to fix some of its water infrastructure issues.",
            "In 2010, the city signed a $90 million contract with Siemens, a private company that was supposed to install new water meters. But the meters were faulty. This led to some customers not receiving bills and others being unable to pay due to being overcharged. Those unpaid bills meant that the ailing system had even fewer resources. The city successfully sued Siemens in 2020, but in the interim, the water system got worse.",
            "Rep. Bennie Thompson (D), who serves Mississippi’s 2nd District, is wary of letting the city control its water. “We want a system that meets federal and state regulations,” he said. “Now if we see that Jackson can’t do it, then obviously we have to look at an alternative.”",
            "But the problems facing Jacksonians, an underinvested and aging system, won’t be helped by privatizing it, water system experts argue. Handing over a public water system to a corporation more concerned with profit has already shown time and time, again, that it won’t fix the problem.",
            "A March 2022 Cornell University study of the 500 largest water systems in the United States found that privatization often resulted in problems.",
            "“What was disturbing about the 500 water systems is that private ones had higher rates and more affordability problems,” said Mildred Warner, a Cornell professor and an author of the study. “And this was true after we controlled for the age of the system and the source of the water.”",
            "There was an outlier, however. California strictly regulates private water companies, ensuring affordability for low-income people. But a Republican governor is unlikely to follow suit. “Mississippi probably doesn’t have the policy environment that’s going to closely regulate the private operator to make sure public objectives are met,” Warner said.",
            "“The history is extensive in terms of what happens when a private company pillages public resources or public utilities,” Lumumba said on NPR. “Private companies are not coming to be benevolent. They’re coming to make a profit.”",
            "Jackson is facing a clear-cut example of environmental racism. After its schools were forced to integrate in the 1970s, white people began leaving the city in droves — taking with them their tax revenue. Today, one in four people in Jackson lives in poverty. The city’s water system is also old and in need of expensive repairs, but the city simply doesn’t have the tax base to support it. Currently, the mayor estimates that the city would need at least $1 billion to permanently fix its water problems.",
            "And while privatization may be on the mind of Reeves and other state officials, there’s plenty of evidence to show that turning Jackson’s water system over to a private company could make the problem worse – which is what happened in Pittsburgh.",
            "The Pennsylvania city’s water and sewer authorities were dealing with aging infrastructure, financial distress, and administrative problems. In 2012, the Pittsburgh water system signed a contract with Veolia to fix its water problems. Under the contract, Veolia would get to keep 50 cents for every dollar that was saved.",
            "The private company, to save costs, switched to a new billing system that often overcharged customers, laid off staff, and perhaps most consequential, used a cheaper corrosion control chemical that led to increased lead levels in the city’s drinking water. Notably, the switch happened without the approval of the utility board or the city.",
            "The utility switched back to the original corrosion control chemical, but residents who were affected still filed a class action lawsuit. The private company and public officials blamed each other for the lead problem, with Veolia saying it was acting as a consulting company only.",
            "While privatization of water companies has led to increased rates and undrinkable water, public water systems aren’t immune to these problems as well. In Flint, Michigan, after the local government switched to cheaper corrosion control, the water was poisoned with lead.",
            "But, just like privatization efforts, the problem began when the city tried to save money.",
            "That’s the central problem with water privatization. It takes a public good — one that’s needed to survive – and turns it into another profit-maker at the expense of residents.",
            "“Privatization is taking people from one state of misery to the next,” Lumumba said. “We have to depart from this notion that privatization is the only way that the system can be supported.”"

            "In a statement Friday, authorities said officials stumbled over one of the snails on a baggage truck and initially thought it was a toy until it started moving. By following the trail left by the 20-centimeter (8-inch) snail, they found a bag with a hole, with another snail already peeping out of it — possibly preparing a dash for freedom.",
            "In total, officials found six bags containing 93 giant snails, 28 kilograms (62 pounds) of fish and smoked meat, and a suitcase full of rotting meat. All had been imported from Nigeria and were destined for an African goods store in western Germany.",

            "“Blade Runner” is about to get the limited series treatment — and Ridley Scott is producing it himself.",
            "Amazon Prime Video has officially greenlighted a sequel series in the sci-fi franchise, The Hollywood Reporter said Thursday. Scott, who directed the initial 1982 film, will executive produce the show alongside “Shining Girls” writer Silka Luisa and Michael Green, who co-wrote the recent follow-up “Blade Runner 2049.”",
            "“The original Blade Runner ... is considered one of the greatest and most influential science-fiction movies of all time, and we’re excited to introduce Blade Runner 2099 to our global Prime Video customers,” Vernon Sanders, Amazon’s head of global television, told the outlet.",
            "While Amazon had already said it was developing the series in February, Thursday’s confirmation yielded new details about the project — which will take place 50 years after the 2017 sequel film that starred Ryan Gosling and brought original lead Harrison Ford back into the fold.",
            "1982′s “Blade Runner,” based on a novel by Philip K. Dick, explored a near future in which armed agents of the state hunt down noncompliant androids, or “replicants,” who abandon their physical labor duties in off-planet colonies.",
            "“[Director] Denis Villeneuve’s follow-up sequel, Blade Runner 2049, then became one of the best reviewed sequels of all time,” Andrew Kosove and Broderick Johnson — the co-CEOs of Alcon Entertainment, which holds the rights to “Blade Runner” — told The Hollywood Reporter in a statement.",
            "“So, we recognize that we have a very high bar to meet with this next installment. … We hope that we can live up to that standard and delight audiences with the next generation of Blade Runner.”",
            "“2049” was a box office disappointment, grossing $92 million domestically, according to Box Office Mojo. Fans of the original, however, were stunned by its quality and the melancholy atmosphere that Villeneuve delivered. It holds an 88% “fresh” rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes.",
            "Adult Swim later produced an animated series called “Blade Runner: Black Lotus,” which debuted in November and appears to have stalled. “2099,” meanwhile, will be the franchise’s first live-action TV project — and has its creators salivating with glee.",
            "“We are delighted to continue our working relationship with our friends at Amazon,” Kosove and Johnson told The Hollywood Reporter. “And we are beyond excited to continue to extend the Blade Runner canon into a new realm with the provocative storyline that Silka has created.”"

            "WASHINGTON — A new bipartisan bill to give Afghans in America a pathway to permanent residency stands a slim chance of winning enough Republican support to become law in the near future.",
            "The U.S. brought in tens of thousands of people as part of its hasty retreat from Afghanistan last year but has not said that they can stay.",
            "The Afghan Adjustment Act, introduced in August by Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) with three Republican co-sponsors, would create a path to permanent residency for more than 77,000 Afghans who have arrived in the U.S. since last summer.",
            "“Giving our Afghan allies – many of whom worked alongside our U.S. Military – a chance to apply for permanent legal status is the right and necessary thing to do,” Klobuchar told HuffPost in a statement. “This bipartisan legislation will provide Afghans who submit to additional vetting a green card to live and work in the United States.”",
            "The bill would also expand eligibility for so-called special immigrant visas to other at-risk groups still in Afghanistan, such as certain former members of the Afghan armed forces.",
            "“These people have no place to go,” bill co-sponsor Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told HuffPost. “Their country has fallen into hell.”",
            "But Graham acknowledged that it would be difficult to win over enough Republicans to get the bill through the Senate, saying his colleagues have “a legitimate concern” that Afghan nationals could pose a security risk.",
            "Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), for instance, argued that President Joe Biden’s administration failed to vet the 80,000 Afghans admitted to the U.S. last year. A Defense Department report from February said its records on 50 Afghan evacuees indicated “potentially significant security concerns.”",
            "“I think we need to start by finding out who’s here and what their background is, and making sure people around the country know where these people went to,” Scott told HuffPost.",
            "As November’s midterm elections approach, Republicans have been more hostile toward immigrants in general, with some describing them as invaders pouring through an insecure southern border. GOP governors have even sent buses and planes full of migrants to Democratic-led cities as a political stunt.",
            "In August 2021, the Biden administration used a measure known as humanitarian parole to allow Afghans to enter the U.S. for a two-year period. Officials ran evacuees’ fingerprints and records through criminal and terrorism databases at military installations in Europe and the Middle East.",
            "Parole is not recognized as an immigration status, and it offers no road to permanent residency. The main options for Afghans are asylum and special immigrant status, but these can be complicated and costly to attain.",
            "The Biden administration announced in March that Afghans would be eligible for temporary protected status, preventing them from having to return to unsafe conditions, but TPS does not guarantee permanent residency.",
            "Advocates of the Afghan Adjustment Act — who point to the fact that Afghans in the U.S. could lose eligibility for humanitarian parole or temporary protected status next year and potentially face deportation — are optimistic about the bill’s prospects.",
            "“Even if we run out of time this month, we have other opportunities to get this done,” said Chris Purdy, the director of Veterans for American Ideals and Outreach at the nonprofit Human Rights First. “Passing this bill is a major priority for members in both houses. And every time we’ve brought this to Congress, we’ve gotten more and more supporters. Passage of the Afghan Adjustment Act is not a matter of if; it’s a matter of when.”",
            "There has been less violence in Afghanistan since the U.S. finished its withdrawal last summer, but the ruling Taliban reportedly still target former members of the military and government officials, despite a declared amnesty. The government is accused of persecuting minority groups and imprisoning and torturing journalists, while women face restrictive new laws. The country is also experiencing an economic crisis, which is primarily the result of frozen assets in the United States, as well as other factors such as drought.",
            "Still, the near future is unlikely to see a critical mass of support for protecting Afghan evacuees, and Republicans could take control of one or both chambers of Congress next year, which would make this even more difficult.",
            "“I just wish we could all agree, conceptually, that the people who are here have no place to go back, and they were involved in a war that we were involved in for 20 years and how we treat them will say a lot about how people will fight with us in the future,” Graham said.",
            "On Thursday, a small number of supporters rallied for the bill outside of Congress.",
            "“Many of those we are advocating for, if not all, have made the ultimate sacrifice by putting their lives in danger protecting democracy and helping our men and women in uniform,” Jawaid Kotwal, an Afghan American, told Huffpost.",
            "“So we owe it to them. We did it in the past, for Vietnamese and Kurds. So it’s the moral responsibility of the U.S. government to protect these people, and those who have already made it, to give them a pathway and road map towards citizenship.”"

(AP) — Sarah Collins Rudolph lost an eye and still has pieces of glass inside her body from a Ku Klux Klan bombing that killed her sister and three other Black girls at an Alabama church 59 years ago, and she’s still waiting on the state to compensate her for those injuries.",
            "Gov. Kay Ivey sidestepped the question of financial compensation two years ago in apologizing to Rudolph for her “untold pain and suffering,” saying legislative involvement was needed. But nothing has been done despite the efforts of attorneys representing Rudolph, leaving unresolved the question of payment even though victims of other attacks, including 9/11, were compensated.",
            "Rudolph, known as the “Fifth Little Girl” for surviving the infamous attack on 16th Street Baptist Church, which was depicted in Spike Lee’s 1997 documentary “4 Little Girls,” has been rankled by the state’s inaction.",
            "Speaking in an interview with The Associated Press, Rudolph said then-Gov. George C. Wallace helped lay the groundwork for the Klan attack with his segregationist rhetoric, and the state bears some responsibility for the bombing, which wasn’t prosecuted for years.",
            "“If they hadn’t stirred up all that racist hate that was going on at the time I don’t believe that church would have been bombed,” said Rudolph.",
            "Rudolph attended a White House summit about combatting hate-fueled violence on Thursday, the anniversary of the bombing, and was recognized by President Joe Biden.",
            "“I visited the church on this day in 2019, and I’ll visit with you and always remember what happened,” Biden told Rudolph.",
            "In Birmingham, hundreds gathered at the church for a commemorative service and wreath-laying at the spot where the bomb went off.",
            "Rudolph said she still incurs medical expenses from the explosion, including a $90 bill she gets every few months for work on the prosthetic she wears in place of the right eye that was destroyed by shrapnel on Sept. 15, 1963. Anything would help, but Rudolph believes she’s due millions.",
            "Ishan Bhabha, an attorney representing Rudolph, said the state’s apology — made at Rudolph’s request along with a plea for restitution — was only meant as a first step.",
            "“She deserves justice in the form of compensation for the grievous injuries, and costs, she has had to bear for almost 60 years,” he said. “We will continue to pursue any available avenues to get Sarah the assistance she needs and deserves.”",
            "Five girls were gathered in a downstairs bathroom at 16th Street Baptist Church when a bomb planted by KKK members went off outside, blowing a huge hole in the thick, brick wall. The blast killed Denise McNair, 11, and three 14-year-olds: Carole Robertson, Cynthia Morris, also referred to as Cynthia Wesley, and Addie Mae Collins, who was Rudolph’s sister.",
            "Three Klan members convicted of murder in the bombing years later died in prison, and a fourth suspect died without ever being charged. The bombing occurred eight months after Wallace proclaimed “segregation forever” in his inaugural speech and during the time when Birmingham schools were being racially integrated for the first time.",
            "The church itself has gotten government money for renovations, as has the surrounding Birmingham Civil Rights National Monument, formed by President Barack Obama in 2017 in one of his last acts in office. “But not me,” Rudolph said.",
            "Ivey, at the time of the apology, said in a letter to Rudolph’s lawyer that any possible compensation would require legislative approval, said press secretary Gina Maiola.",
            "“Additionally, in attorney-to-attorney conversations that ensued soon after, that same point was reiterated,” she said.",
            "No bill has been introduced to compensate Rudolph, legislative records show, and it’s unclear whether such legislation could win passage anyway since conservative Republicans hold an overwhelming majority and have made an issue of reeling in history lessons that could make white people feel bad about the past.",

            "JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Carey Wooten spent nearly seven weeks hunting for safe drinking water for herself, her two children and three dogs after clocking out each day as a Taco Bell manager, so Gov. Tate Reeves' announcement that the water is clean again in Mississippi's capital came as welcome news.",
            "But the crisis in the city of Jackson isn't over, even if its boil-water advisory was lifted on Thursday. While the state plans to stop handing out free bottled water at sites around the city Saturday night, the city said water pressure still hasn’t been fully restored, and state health officials said lead in some pipes remains so worrisome that pregnant women and young children should still use bottled water.",
            "“The water that’s coming out of my kitchen sink smells like fresh sewage ... as soon as you turn it on, it hits you right in the face. It’s horrible,” Wooten said earlier this month. “I’ve tried to give one of my dogs the water, but when she smells it she won’t even touch it. She walks away from it.”",
            "Wooten said Friday that the liquid flowing into her kitchen sink still smells like sewage, but not as bad as before, and she's glad she won't have to run to distribution sites before their bottled water supplies run out each day.",
            "Other residents told The Associated Press on Friday that their water remains too discolored to count on, so now they'll have to rely on water distribution by community-run charities or buy water again themselves, adding insult to injury.",
            "Jackson had already been under a state health department boil-water notice for a month when torrential rain fell in August, flooding the Pearl River and overwhelming the treatment system. Water pressure abruptly dropped, emptying faucets for days.",
            "How did this happen? Residents, politicians, experts and activists say systemic racism is the root cause.",
            "Jackson's population has declined since 1980, a decade after the city's schools began integrating. Many white families left for the suburbs, leaving less revenue to maintain the infrastructure. Middle class Black people then moved out to escape urban decay and rising crime. State and federal spending never made up the difference.",
            "“The legacy of racial zoning, segregation, legalized redlining have ultimately led to the isolation, separation and sequestration of racial minorities into communities (with) diminished tax bases, which has had consequences for the built environment, including infrastructure,” said Marccus Hendricks, an associate professor of urban studies and planning at the University of Maryland.",
            "Other cities across the United States could face similar challenges with aging water systems that are ill-equipped to handle more intense and frequent flooding caused by climate change, experts in water infrastructure and environmental justice told The Associated Press.",
            "And when it comes to water scarcity and contamination, they say working-class communities of color are most vulnerable. Jackson's population is more than 80% Black and the poverty level is 24.5%, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Majority-Black Flint, Michigan, has struggled to remove lead from its water since 2014. Other areas where large poor or nonwhite populations lack reliably safe drinking water include major cities like Baltimore and Honolulu as well as smaller municipalities like Las Vegas, New Mexico; and Benton Harbor, Michigan.",
            "Heather McTeer Toney worked to clean up discolored tap water as mayor of Greenville, Mississippi, before serving as the Environmental Protection Agency’s southeast regional administrator from 2014 to 2017. Now she works on environmental justice issues nationwide for the Environmental Defense Fund. She said many majority-minority communities lack consistent access to clean water.",
            "“Any community that is suffering from lack of infrastructure maintenance is dealing with the same problem, maybe just on a different scale,” Toney said. “But across the nation, with .... poor communities that are often Black, brown, Indigenous and on the frontlines of the climate crisis, we see the same thing happening over and over again.”",
            "Hendricks and Toney blame systemic racism for government disinvestment in communities of color. Maisie Brown calls Jackson’s troubles “the product of environmental racism.”",
            "“I don’t think we realize how deeply ingrained racism is in all of our structures and systems, including infrastructure,” said Brown, a 20-year-old student at Jackson State University who was born and raised in the city.",
            "Brown is a member of the Mississippi Students Water Crisis Advocacy Team, a group of about 30 students delivering water to residents who are disabled, elderly or don’t have vehicles. That’s what relief has looked like in Jackson — the people most affected doing what they can to help each other. But the limited handouts each day haven't been enough, forcing people to buy water in stores.",
            "The two cases Wooten and nearly 500 others picked up at the site in south Jackson one day contained just under nine gallons (30 liters). That's less than 3% of the roughly 300 gallons (1,136 liters) that the EPA says the average American family uses each day.",
            "Needed improvements at the city's two treatment plants include replacing ineffective pumps, leaky filters, faulty membranes and corroded pipes; removing accumulated sludge and hiring enough qualified staff to properly manage the system. Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba, a Democrat, has pleaded for patience while seeking state and federal help, saying such fixes could cost billions of dollars that the city doesn’t have.",
            "EPA Administrator Michael Regan said while visiting Jackson that he wants the city to get its fair share of federal money flowing to the state.",
            "Reeves, a Republican, has not said how much Mississippi should spend on solving this problem. The legislature directed $400 million of federal pandemic relief funds toward water infrastructure upgrades around the state, but it’s unclear how much Jackson will receive because cities are still applying for money. \"We cannot perfectly predict what may go wrong with such a broken system in the future,” Reeves said Thursday.",
            "Without reliable funding streams, many Jackson residents don’t expect to see consistently drinkable water anytime soon.",
            "Karla McCullough, 46, is a Black woman and Jackson native who runs a charity that helped organize the distribution site where Wooten got her water. She told the AP that the city's residents have experienced some level of water scarcity their entire lives.",
            "“I want to be hopeful and optimistic,” McCullough said. “In my lifetime, I may not see the infrastructure fixed and it restored to a point where there are not any water issues. But my hope is that my son and his children won’t have to deal with this.”",

            "NEW YORK (AP) — “The Phantom of the Opera” — Broadway’s longest-running show — is scheduled to close in February 2023, the biggest victim victim yet of the post-pandemic softening in theater attendance in New York.",
            "The musical — a fixture on Broadway since 1988, weathering recessions, war and cultural shifts — will play its final performance on Broadway on Feb. 18, a spokesperson told The Associated Press on Friday. The closing will come less than a month after its 35th anniversary.",
            "It is a costly musical to sustain, with elaborate sets and costumes as well as a large cast and orchestra. Box office grosses have fluctuated since the show reopened after the pandemic — going as high as over $1 million a week but also dropping to around $850,000. Last week, it hit $867,997 and producers may have seen the writing on the wall.",
            "Based on a novel by Gaston Leroux, “Phantom” tells the story of a deformed composer who haunts the Paris Opera House and falls madly in love with an innocent young soprano, Christine. Andrew Lloyd Webber’s lavish songs include “Masquerade,” ″Angel of Music,” ″All I Ask of You” and “The Music of the Night.”",
            "The first production opened in London in 1986 and since then the show has been seen by more than 145 million people in 183 cities and performed in 17 languages over 70,000 performances. On Broadway alone, the musical has played more than 13,500 performances to 19 million people at The Majestic Theatre.",
            "The closing of “Phantom” would mean the longest running show crown would go to “Chicago,” which started in 1996. “The Lion King” is next, having begun performances in 1997.",
            "Broadway took a pounding during the pandemic, with all theaters closed for more than 18 months. Breaking even usually requires a steady stream of tourists, especially to “Phantom.”",
            "The closure was first reported Friday by the New York Post."

            "The records produced by Meadows are the same ones he earlier provided to a House committee conducting a similar investigation, according to the person, who spoke with The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing Justice Department probe.",
            "The subpoena to Meadows, first reported by CNN, makes clear that Justice Department officials are seeking information from the most senior of Trump’s White House advisers as they examine wide-ranging efforts to overturn the results of the election won by Democrat Joe Biden.",
            "The department, whose work at times has mirrored or overlapped with that of the committee, this month served a broad wave of grand jury subpoenas and search warrants to Trump allies.",
            "Meadows has been a pivotal figure in the House investigation, his name invoked repeatedly in testimony by other Trump advisers, including by his own top aide. He had provided the committee with thousands of text messages, including communications with outside Trump allies and advisers.",
            "In a filing in April in a federal lawsuit over his House subpoena, a lawyer for Meadows accused the committee of trying to vilify him publicly, noting that all of the texts it had been provided had been disclosed to the news media. The committee declined at the time to respond to the accusation.",
            "Meadows did not provide to the committee records he believed were subject to claims of executive privilege and those documents were also not produced to the Justice Department.",

Read about film archivist Maya Cade, internet stars Keyon Elkins and Drew Afualo, rapper Latashá, music historian Katelina Eccleston, filmmaker Alika Tengan, artists Kay Rufai and Ani Liu, and actors Rhoyle Ivy King and Nicco Annan.",
            "Alex Aster grips a tall Starbucks hot chocolate in her right hand as she guides me through the second floor of the world’s largest Barnes & Noble bookstore.",
            "“I come here several times a week,” she says, pointing to a corner of the Young Adult section that often acts as a background for her many viral TikToks. “I usually stack two or three books to create a sort of stand.”",
            "She demonstrates her typical filming strategy, which is a test of both physics and balance, and points out the spot where her anticipated YA novel, “Lightlark,” will sit on the shelves; it’s just above best-selling authors Victoria Aveyard and Leigh Bardugo.",
            "We spend the next 30 minutes wandering the stacks hunting for Jennette McCurdy’s hotly debated memoir, “I’m Glad My Mom Died.” Despite our best efforts — and introverted refusal to ask for help — we can’t find the book. Instead, she buys a beige tote bag with a picture of her second home, the famed Union Square B&N in New York City, and “Big Magic” by Elizabeth Gilbert. She gives me the book, recounting how it completely changed her life.",
            "While the “Eat, Pray, Love” author might have bettered Aster’s insight into her own creativity, it’s not the only thing that changed the course of her life. That accolade goes to TikTok — or, more specifically, BookTok, a community on the social media platform dedicated to readers and authors who share their favorite books, characters and literary anecdotes.",
            "After hundreds of rejections — seriously, she’s been writing books and querying agents since she was 12 years old — Aster joined TikTok in March 2021 to share the concept of a young adult novel she’d been working on for several years. The novel, “Lightlark,” had recently received tons of rejections from publishers and she was determined to prove that she wasn’t the only person in the world who wanted to read it.",
            "“Every single publisher was mainly saying that the genre is so saturated. That’s when I decided to make the TikTok video ... I put everything I love into [“Lightlark”] and so it [was] me asking the void, asking the internet, ‘Would you read this book?’”",
            "The video, which has since received over 1.8 million views, over 363,000 likes, and more than 56,000 saves, shows Alex scrolling through her manuscript before cutting away to a series of fantasy-inspired Pinterest photos to what sounds like a new-age ballad. The captions on her video read: “Would you read a book about a cursed island that only appears once every hundred years to host a game that gives the six rulers of [each] realm a chance to break their curses? Each realm’s curse is deadly and to break them, one of the six rulers must die. To survive, Isla Crown must lie, cheat, betray even as love complicates everything.”",
            "With fate, an enticing story, and the algorithm on her side, her video went viral overnight. Her novel went to auction and sold two weeks later in a deal that was 10 times what she was paid for her critically acclaimed, award-winning middle grade series “Emblem Island.”",
            "“It was like a bunch of years of work mixed with, like, luck that I could never have anticipated,” Aster says of the viral video. She even accidentally started her own trend, with hundreds of other writers pitching their novels in a similar format with the same audio.",
            "Aster and her publisher, Abrams Books, have used TikTok ever since to help market the novel. They even went as far as to let BookTok pick the cover of the novel, an unheard of option in the realm of traditional publishing, which usually takes years of marketing research and trend reports into account. The cover, which received over 10,000 votes in a weekend, was then revealed on a massive billboard in Times Square.",
            "“My publisher has been extremely open and collaborative; this is a new generation, Gen Z is shopping differently and they really care about the person behind the book,” Aster said. “If I’ve done anything revolutionary, it’s probably that I crowdsource my audience for publishing ... it’s been very cool to see this very old industry be able to shift so quickly to meet with this new trend that is BookTok that’s literally changing the industry.”",
            "A year and a half after posting her initial video to TikTok, “Lightlark” is on the shelves, a timeline considered rushed by publishing standards. Even before the novel came out, Aster landed a massive movie deal with the producers of “Twilight” — she’s Team Edward, by the way — and her agents secured publishing rights in 13 languages. She also became one of the most followed authors on TikTok with nearly 1 million followers and started work on a sequel to the novel. “Lightlark” had a first-print run of over 200,000 copies, almost unheard of in the publishing industry.",
            "While some authors claim BookTok doesn’t move the needle in terms of sales, Aster’s proved them wrong, becoming an instant New York Times bestseller. “Lightlark” debuted at No. 1 during its first week of publication — proof that the community she cultivated did buy her novel. The year’s worth of daily TikTok posts and Instagram questionnaires were well worth the time and effort, despite the naysayers.",
            "Now, she’s well on her way to becoming Gen Z’s Stephanie Meyer — sans questionable BIPOC representation — at just 27 years old. In between writing the sequel to her novel at coffee shops with fellow Gen Z author Chloe Gong, sharing her custom-made “Lightlark” mugs on Instagram or taking followers on one of her mid-afternoon iced coffee runs on TikTok, Aster’s giving us a behind-the-scenes look into the life of a published author. And this might be the new norm for up-and-coming authors of this generation and those who come after. They’ve grown up with social media and know how to navigate each app to build a connection with their readers in a way that feels authentic, not elitist, and inspires them to pursue their own dreams.",
            "“It’s really cool because we’re just peers with our readers. It’s not like the author is above the reader anymore. We’re one of the readers, and I think that lends to a community of discussion and collaboration that wasn’t really there before,” Aster said. “I get to interact with people in a way that maybe wasn’t possible before. I recognize people’s names when they message me and it just gives me access to my readers in a way that I don’t think was possible before. We want to be a part of these communities. We don’t want to be separate from them.”",
            "“I think what really resonates with people is that I’ve never shied away from sharing my struggles,” she said of her journey. “I just never wanted to gloss over the negative part [of this industry]. I was never the best writer, I was never the best person, the best author, I was literally just the person who didn’t give up ... why paint a pretty picture when it’s just not the truth? I have failed way more than I’ve succeeded in my life. I just didn’t stop.”",
            "Still, despite her hard-earned success, some BookTok creators have questioned whether or not Aster is a “industry plant.” Aster grew up on television, where she and her twin sister, Daniella Pierson — one of the youngest multi-millionaires in the world — starred in her parent’s Jacksonville Toyota dealership commercials. She acknowledges the financial privilege she has, noting in the comments of one TikTok video that she has zero student debt, was able to live with family while she wrote her novels, and is on her fiancé’s health insurance, but stresses that she had no industry connections in publishing or film prior to her viral success. She also confirmed to HuffPost that she did not put any paid promotion behind any of her TikToks.",
            "“I know people are confused about how I got a movie deal before the book is published, but the truth is that happens all the time ... I’m proud to say that I didn’t have or use any connections to get my book or movie deal,” she said. “I think people only see the last year of my life that has been rapidly successful, but the truth is I’ve been writing and trying to get published for over a decade. Also, industry plants in publishing are not a thing. I think it’s unfortunate people will grasp at straws to try to invalidate someone’s success, but ultimately I think it’s more of a reflection on them than it is on me.”",
            "In fact, it might be Aster’s minor in consumer psychology that makes her such a powerful marketer for rapid success. She knows how to relate to the audience she’s appealing to and is open and honest about all her experiences, even if they sometimes seem too good to be true. Even before the original “Lightlark” TikTok went viral, Aster had become an up-and-coming TikTok star with several of her own songs becoming trending sounds. Bella Poarch, who now has over 91 million followers, used her song “You Think You’re” in a video in late 2020. While Aster has since removed the music from the app — she says the music industry is “even worse than publishing” and didn’t want her new followers to be confused when finding her through BookTok — her aptitude for consumer marketing and the TikTok algorithm remain. That, and her passion for publishing the best book possible.",
            "Aster had always wanted to be a novelist. She spent every day after middle school writing in her room or Barnes & Noble and even spent a majority of her high school lunches hunched over a laptop working on yet another manuscript. By the time she graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2017, she’d written four books and finally had gotten an agent. In fact, she landed her agent the day she graduated and even skipped her commencement ceremony to finalize her choice among three offering agents. She describes the moment “like fate,” until it all came crashing down.",
            "After her first book, an adult thriller, didn’t sell to a publisher, she left her agent and started working on a middle-grade series based on her Colombian heritage. Unfortunately, despite starred reviews and awards, “Emblem Island” was released during the pandemic and, like many other debut works during this time, saw slow sales. She eventually parted ways with her second agent and wrote the first draft of “Lightlark” sans representation. Even after landing a third agent, “Lightlark” continued to be rejected. It’s for this reason Aster attributes her latest novel’s publication entirely to the BookTok community. She says she feels both indebted and grateful that they saw something in her plea to the void. “I would have never been in this position if it wasn’t for their support.”",
            "Transparency is at the heart of Aster’s own approach to social media. She posts several times a day on TikTok and Instagram, giving readers an intimate look into her life as an author. From signing copies of her novel for seven hours straight to flying across the country on short notice for secret “Lightlark” business trips, she documents every part of her writing journey.",
            "“I’m on social media more than I write,” Aster said. “I think it’s a new thing for authors to be required and also expected to have a social media platform. There is a lot of pressure ... it has played such a huge role in my career that I can’t stop and so it’s the biggest blessing and something I’m extremely grateful for, but it’s a lot of additional work. I have to keep up with it because of the algorithm and because now people are expecting it from me.”",
            "While she might spend upward of five hours every single day filming TikToks that’ll never see the light of day (seriously, she says she has thousands of unposted drafts), she says she can’t complain because the entire community has made her lifelong dream a reality.",
            "Still, with her newfound internet stardom comes a host of trolls and people who want to discount her years of hard work and dedication. Even worse, some of the commenters on her videos have referred to her as a white author (she’s of Indigenous Colombian ancestry). Aster says she’s even noticed this happening within the publishing industry itself. As a Latina who previously wrote a book inspired by her Latin roots, she says there was a sort of tokenization that happened for “Emblem Island” that isn’t happening for “Lightlark.” While “Lightlark” might not be marketed as a Latinx book, it is still written by a Latina author and contains tons of nods to Aster’s heritage, like the main character’s name being Isla, which means island in Spanish.",
            "But, Aster’s not letting TikTok or the publishing industry erase her identity. She doesn’t shy away from correcting people who incorrectly call her white and she isn’t afraid to talk about the pigeonholing that happened when she was on submission for “Emblem Island.”",
            "“I did hear some of the stuff that you think of as horror stories ... like big editors said ‘Oh, we already have like a Latinx book, and it’s better than this one.’ And to get that feedback, I saw at that point, there’s only a limited number of spaces for Latinx books and Latinx authors. And so it’s really interesting now that [“Lightlark” wasn’t marketed as a Latinx book] that suddenly there’s all this space.”",
            "Even when it comes to the panels she’s asked to speak on now. Before, she was only invited to Latinx author panels. Now, she’s been invited to speak at Comic-Con on a panel that has nothing to do with race or ethnicity.",
            "“It’s definitely interesting to see the different response when this isn’t blatantly marketed as a Latinx book. I’ve seen both parts of the industry, the industry that doesn’t have enough room for me because they have a certain amount of books and then the industry that opens up because suddenly like, for some reason, this book is different. It’s a complicated feeling.”",
            "Aster notes that when her publisher was marketing “Emblem Island,” it was usually referred to only as a Latinx fantasy. While she was grateful that people who were looking for that specific type of book could find it, she got to a point where she wanted the series simply to be referred to as a fantasy. “At some level, it’s not like you talk about a book and say, ‘It’s like a Russian magic system’ or ‘It’s a French magic system’; no, you just talk about it as a fantasy.”",
            "Thankfully, BookTok influencers are saving the day when it comes to making sure novels by people of color are getting their flowers. Aster shouted out a few creators like @aymansbooks, @thecalvinsbooks, and even the founder of BookTok herself, @caitsbooks, who act as trendsetters in the book community.",
            "“They’re deciding what people are reading ... they’re the new tastemakers of the industry,” she said, noting that even someone with a thousand followers can go viral and become an instant literary arbiter. “I think [TikTok] is changing the book industry. [Now,] it’s not just whatever books are in the front row with a shelf that’s what’s going to sell. It’s whatever books are resonating with people and I think people are getting a lot more chances. I think there’s a lot of power in that anyone, even if you have one follower or a million followers, you can go viral. There’s a lot of hope in that.”",
            "Needless to say, Aster’s come a long way from writing novels in her childhood bedroom. “Lightlark” is just the beginning of what’s sure to be an incredibly successful career. The YA novel is full of wonder, magic, and even a to-die-for love triangle that easily rivals “Twilight” (she’s Team Isla, for what it’s worth). And, while she’s thrilled with the reception “Lightlark” continues to get from fans around the world, she wants other aspiring authors to not be so hard on themselves.",
            "“I was really sad for many years because I thought I was a failure. But, looking back, I see everything happened the way it was supposed to, I just needed to be a little more patient and a little kinder to myself.”",
            "It’s this kindness that, perhaps, makes Aster a breath of fresh air in the world of publishing. And part of the reason she identifies so closely with the Starling realm in her book. She’s ethereal, dedicated, creative and ready to start a new era in the publishing world."

            "The one-minute video was filmed by a witness from the safety of their car. It shows Gordon tackling a man to the ground and putting him in a headlock. His colleagues eventually arrived, alongside a woman carrying her baby — who doled out some verbal justice.",
            "“She had a baby in her hand,” the woman screamed. “She had a baby in her hand! How dare you! How dare you scare her like that!”",
            "Footage shows Gordon standing up after winning the fight and placing his hands on the other man to ensure he stayed put. The man remained seated on the concrete without causing problems until authorities placed him in handcuffs.",
            "“A major shout out to this young man for his courage!” the sheriff’s office told the Post.",
            "Gordon had potentially saved somebody’s life before. He was taking orders outside the Fort Walton Beach location in September 2008 when he saw a crane collapse and crash onto a nearby car.",
            "Gordon rushed over and noticed a teenage driver and her friend trapped inside, according to the Northwest Florida Daily News. He told the outlet he carried one of them to safety before bystanders sprung into action to help the other.",
            "“I didn’t have any time to react,” Gordon told the paper. “It was nothing but instinct, and I ran to the car.”",
            "Branch was booked on charges of battery and carjacking with a weapon. While it’s unclear whether Gordon will be promoted for his unrelated heroism, the operator of his Chick-fil-A location, Matthew Sexton, certainly seemed impressed.",
            "“I couldn’t be prouder of his incredible act of care,” he said."

            "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Business and government officials are bracing for the possibility of a nationwide rail strike at the end of this week while talks carry on between the largest U.S. freight railroads and their unions.",
            "The railroads have already started to curtail shipments of hazardous materials and have announced plans to stop hauling refrigerated products ahead of Friday’s strike deadline. Now businesses that rely on Norfolk Southern, Union Pacific, BNSF, CSX, Kansas City Southern and other railroads to deliver their raw materials and finished products have started planning for the worst.",
            "Meanwhile, Biden administration officials are scrambling to develop a plan to use trucks, ships and planes to try to keep the most crucial chemicals and other goods moving if the railroads stop rolling. But the White House is also keeping the pressure on the two sides to settle their differences, and a growing number of business groups are lobbying Congress to be prepared to intervene and block a strike if they can’t reach an agreement.",
            "“We have made crystal clear to the interested parties the harm that American families, business and farmers and communities would experience if they were not to reach a resolution,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday. She said a shutdown is “not acceptable.”",
            "In addition to all the businesses that rely on railroads to deliver their goods, passenger railroads are also affected because many of them operate on tracks owned by one of the freight railroads. Amtrak has already cancelled several of its long-distance trains because there wouldn’t be enough time for them to reach their destinations before a strike or lockout would be allowed to begin at 12:01 a.m. Friday.",
            "Amtrak already suspended its California Zephyr and Empire Builder lines that run from Chicago to the West Coast, and starting Wednesday it will stop running its City of New Orleans, Starlight and Texas Eagle lines along with several others.",
            "Commuter railroads would also be affected. In Chicago, Metra warned its riders that it wouldn’t be able to run most of its trains if there is a strike.",
            "The railroads have reached tentative agreements with most of their unions, including a ninth deal announced Tuesday, based on the recommendations of a Presidential Emergency Board Joe Biden appointed this summer that called for 24% raises and $5,000 in bonuses in a five-year deal that’s retroactive to 2020. The deal also includes one additional paid leave day a year and higher health insurance costs.",
            "But all 12 railroad unions must agree to prevent a strike. The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen union that represents engineers, and the Transportation Division of the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers union that represents conductors want the railroads to address some of their concerns about unpredictable work schedules and strict attendance rules in addition to agreeing to the recommended wage increases.",
            "Ron Kaminkow, general secretary of the Railroad Workers United labor coalition that includes workers from a variety of railroad unions, said he doesn’t think the unions are demanding much at this point — just the kind of things most U.S. workers already enjoy like the ability to take time off without being penalized.",
            "“We have attendance policies that have gotten more and more and more draconian. That offer very, very little leeway for workers who need to take time off for doctor’s appointments, for time with family, to be rested,” Kaminkow said.",
            "Starting Monday, all the major railroads put a hold on shipments of hazardous materials to ensure those dangerous chemicals wouldn’t be stranded along the tracks if there is a strike. Norfolk Southern told its customers that it will also stop accepting shipments of intermodal containers full of goods starting Wednesday evening as it prepares “for a controlled shutdown of the network.”",
            "Some businesses would likely be affected more than others by a rail shutdown. For instance, nearly all ethanol and coal and most grain moves by rail.",

            "Magaziner, a business-friendly liberal who raised the most money in the field and was endorsed by Langevin, defeated five other contenders seeking the Democratic nomination in Rhode Island’s 2nd Congressional District. His victory is a win for the state’s Democratic Party establishment and allied groups, which saw him as the most viable general-election candidate.",
            "Magaziner is due to face Republican nominee Allan Fung, the former mayor of Cranston, Rhode Island, in November.",
            "National Republicans have indicated that they plan to seriously contest the seat. They see Fung, who characterizes himself as a centrist, as the kind of candidate who can win in a politically and geographically diverse district that President Joe Biden would have carried by 14 percentage points in 2020.",
            "But Democrats plan to lump Fung in with his Republican backers, turning the race into a referendum on GOP control of the House rather than Fung’s personal merits or reputation as a mayor.",
            "“There’s certainly nothing moderate about supporting [House Republican Leader] Kevin McCarthy, who has made clear that he wants to cut Social Security and Medicare and pass a national abortion ban,” Magaziner told HuffPost last week.",
            "McCarthy has indicated that he will entertain legislation restricting abortion on a national level but has not specified his plans.",
            "Fung, who supports allowing abortions in cases of rape and incest, has said he would not prioritize limits on abortion rights, though he did not rule out support for federal bans in an interview with The Boston Globe after the U.S. Supreme Court’s abortion-restricting decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health in June.",
            "But Fung gave Democrats an opening to nationalize the race in August when he welcomed McCarthy to Rhode Island for a fundraiser. He also attended a retreat for Republican donors that McCarthy hosted in Wyoming later that month.",
            "Fung, who ran two competitive but ultimately unsuccessful races for governor, identifies as a fiscal conservative focused on trimming budgets and improving government services for constituents. The son of immigrants from Hong Kong, Fung would be Rhode Island’s first non-white member of Congress.",
            "“I would definitely be proud to kind of kick open that bamboo ceiling, ensure that other individuals can follow behind,” he told the Globe. “But the most important thing is those pocketbook issues, wallet issues, that we’re all facing in Rhode Island and as a country.”",
            "Magaziner, whose father, Ira, was a successful management consultant and adviser to former President Bill Clinton, was born into a storied family in Democratic politics. He parlayed his upbringing and his family’s financial success into a career in state politics, where he endeared himself to organized labor with his support for policies such as a state infrastructure bank.",
            "During the primary, Magaziner, who dropped out of the governor’s race to run for Congress, successfully argued that his record of statewide electoral success made him the best candidate to defeat Fung. He triumphed over former Langevin aide Joy Fox, former Biden administration official Sarah Morgenthau, former state Rep. David Segal, refugee activist Omar Bah and former state Rep. Spencer Dickinson.",
            "Magaziner and Morgenthau were the only two candidates with the resources to advertise on television.",
            "One potential liability for Magaziner is that until a few months ago he lived just outside the boundaries of Rhode Island’s 2nd District. He and his family now rent a home in the district, and he touts his experience working in the district as general treasurer."

            "TikTok may be the platform of choice for catchy videos, but anyone using it to learn about COVID-19, climate change or Russia's invasion of Ukraine is likely to encounter misleading information, according to a research report published Wednesday.",
            "Researchers at NewsGuard searched for content about prominent news topics on TikTok and say they found that nearly 1 in 5 of the videos automatically suggested by the platform contained misinformation.",
            "Searches for information about “mRNA vaccine,\" for instance, yielded five videos (out of the first 10) that contained misinformation, including baseless claims that the COVID-19 vaccine causes “permanent damage in children's critical organs.”",
            "Researchers looking for information about abortion, the 2020 election, the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, climate change or Russia's invasion of Ukraine on TikTok found similarly misleading videos scattered among more accurate clips.",
            "The amount of misinformation — and the ease with which it can be found — is especially troubling given TikTok's popularity with young people, according to Steven Brill, founder of NewsGuard, a firm that monitors misinformation.",
            "TikTok is the second most popular domain in the world, according to online performance and security company Cloudflare, exceeded only by Google.",
            "Brill questioned whether ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, is doing enough to stop misinformation or whether it deliberately allows misinformation to proliferate as a way to sow confusion in the U.S. and other Western democracies.",
            "“It's either incompetence or it's something worse,” Brill told The Associated Press.",
            "TikTok released a statement in response to NewsGuard's report noting that its community guidelines prohibit harmful misinformation and that it works to promote authoritative content about important topics like COVID-19.",
            "“We do not allow harmful misinformation, including medical misinformation, and we will remove it from the platform,” the company said.",
            "TikTok has taken other steps that it says are intended to direct users to trustworthy sources. This year, for example, the company created an election center to help U.S. voters find voting places or information about candidates.",
            "The platform removed more than 102 million videos that violated its rules in the first quarter of 2022. Yet only a tiny percentage of those ran afoul of TikTok's rules against misinformation.",
            "Researchers found that TikTok's own search tool seems designed to steer users to false claims in some cases. When researchers typed the words “COVID vaccine\" into the search tool, for instance, the tool suggested searches on key words including “COVID vaccine exposed\" and \"COVID vaccine injury.\"",
            "When the same search was run on Google, however, that search engine suggested searches relating to more accurate information about vaccine clinics, the different types of vaccines and booster shots.",
            "TikTok's rise in popularity has caught the attention of state officials and federal lawmakers, some of whom have expressed concerns about its data privacy and security.",

            "WASHINGTON (AP) — Sharply lower prices for gas and cheaper used cars slowed U.S. inflation in August for a second straight month, though many other items rose in price, indicating that inflation remains a heavy burden for American households.",
            "Consumer prices surged 8.3% in August compared with a year earlier, the government said Tuesday. Though still painfully high, that was down from an 8.5% jump in July and a four-decade high of 9.1% in June. On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.1%, after a flat reading in July.",
            "Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, so-called core prices jumped 0.6% from July to August, higher than many economists had expected and a sign of inflation’s persistence.",
            "Inflation remains far higher than many Americans have ever experienced and is keeping pressure on the Federal Reserve, the agency tasked with keeping prices stable. The Fed is expected to announce another big increase in its benchmark interest rate next week, which will lead to higher costs for many consumer and business loans.",
            "Inflation has escalated families’ grocery bills, rents and utility costs, among other expenses, inflicting hardships on many households and deepening gloom about the economy despite strong job growth and low unemployment.",
            "Even if inflation peaks, economists expect it could take two years or more to fall back to something close to the Fed’s annual 2% target. The cost of rental apartments and other services, such as health care, are likely to keep rising in the months ahead.",
            "Republicans have sought to make inflation a central issue in the midterm congressional elections. They blame President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package passed last year for much of the increase. Many economists generally agree, though they also say that snarled supply chains, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and widespread shortages of items like semiconductors have been key factors in the inflation surge.",
            "Yet the signs that inflation might have peaked — or will soon — could bolster Democrats’ prospects in the midterm elections and may already have contributed to slightly higher public approval ratings for Biden. In his speeches, Biden has generally stopped referring to the impact of high prices on family budgets. He has instead highlighted his administration’s recent legislative accomplishments, including a law enacted last month that’s intended to reduce pharmaceutical prices and fight climate change.",
            "Nationally, the average cost of a gallon of gas has dropped to $3.71, down from just above $5 in mid-June. Many businesses are also reporting signs that supply backlogs and inflation are beginning to fade.",
            "General Motors has said the pandemic disruptions to overseas production of semiconductors, which have reduced auto output, have largely dissipated and that supply chain disruptions overall have improved about 80% from the worst days of the pandemic.",
            "Over the past year, prices of meat, milk and fruits and vegetables have soared by double-digits. But executives at Kroger, the nation’s largest grocery chain, said that falling prices for farm commodities like wheat and corn could slow cost increases for food.",
            "Next week, most Fed watchers expect the central bank to announce a third straight three-quarter-point hike, to a range of 3% to 3.25%. The Fed’s rapid rate increases — the fastest since the early 1980s — typically lead to higher costs for mortgages, auto loans and business loans, with the goal of slowing growth and reducing inflation. The average 30-year mortgage rate jumped to nearly 5.9% last week, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac, the highest figure in nearly 14 years.",
            "Chair Jerome Powell has said the Fed will need to see several months of low inflation readings that suggest price increases are falling back toward its 2% target before it might suspend its rate hikes.",
            "Wages are still rising at a strong pace — before adjusting for inflation — which has elevated demand for apartments as more people move out on their own. A shortage of available houses has also forced more people to keep renting, thereby intensifying competition for apartments.",
            "Rising rents and more expensive services, such as medical care, are also keeping inflation high."

            "An elusive intellectual with a disdain for most modern American movies, Godard was a defining figure of the French New Wave, that unofficial troop of 1950s and ’60s filmmakers whose idiosyncratic work fixated on social and political unrest. Godard outlived most of his peers, including François Truffaut, Éric Rohmer, Jacques Rivette and Claude Chabrol.",
            "Born in Paris on Dec. 3, 1930, Gordard enjoyed a life of wealth and literary scholarship. His father was a French-born physician who gained citizenship in Switzerland, where the family lived for many years. His mother was the daughter of upscale bankers. Godard discovered an affinity for movies after World War II, when he began visiting the Cinémathèque Française, which houses one of the world’s largest film archives. It was there that he met Truffaut, Rohmer, Rivette and Chabrol. These five young men became fast friends, and Godard began spending his free time engaging with cinema. He was determined to restore silent-film values to the well-established world of talkies.",
            "Godard’s first brush with notoriety came as a critic writing for the admired new French magazine Cahiers du Cinéma, co-founded by André Bazin, a grandfather of the auteur theory. Godard’s writing presaged the qualities we’d soon see in his own films, chiefly the notion that movies are just as powerful an art form as novels, poetry and painting.",
            "Godard’s big-screen debut is one of the most auspicious directorial introductions in history, every bit as promising as D.W. Griffith’s “The Birth of a Nation” (minus the racism), Orson Welles’ “Citizen Kane,” Mike Nichols’ “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” and Quentin Tarantino’s “Reservoir Dogs.” That movie is 1960’s “Breathless,” a freewheeling drama about a charming French hoodlum and the American exchange student he loves. Initially envisioned as a documentary, “Breathless” was shot with handheld cameras and non-artificial lighting to achieve a naturalistic feel ― novel concepts at the time. Godard was the first to use prominent jump-cuts, today considered a groundbreaking advancement in film editing.",
            "“Breathless” was met with ravenous reviews. In 2010, New York Times critic A.O. Scott wrote, “Even now, at 50, it is still cool, still new, still — after all this time! — a bulletin from the future of movies.” A 2016 poll in the British magazine Sight & Sound named “Breathless” the 13th greatest movie of all time.",
            "Godard again found acclaim with the 1963 backstage drama “Contempt” and the 1964 crime comedy “Band of Outsiders,” which appeared on Time magazine’s list of the 100 greatest movies. His overall career grew increasingly political after “Breathless,” chronicling such topics as financial gloom (1962’s “My Life to Live”), the horrors of war (1963’s “The Carabineers”) and consumerism (1967’s “Weekend”). Godard’s staunch opposition to the Vietnam War was a trademark of 1967’s “Two or Three Things I Know About Her.” All the while, his work became less commercial and more elliptical. Many projected Marxist interpretations onto Godard’s filmography, though he said in a rare interview in 2016, that he had never read Karl Marx’s writings.",
            "Throughout most of his post-1960s career, Godard’s movies were not widely released in America. Regardless, his stature as a legend hardly waned. He found a minor second wind with 1982’s “Passion,” a story about filmmaking that starred Isabelle Huppert, but most of his work was dense and obscure. In 1987, his “King Lear,” a postmodern abstraction that borrows elements of the Shakespeare tragedy, premiered at the Cannes Film Festival and saw a quick two-week run stateside. In 1998, Godard completed “Histoire(s) du cinéma,” a nearly four-hour, subjective rumination on film history that some consider the most important piece of his later career. The director was awarded an honorary Oscar in 2011, but he did not travel to America to accept the prize.",
            "Despite making 18 movies between 1980 and his death, 2010’s divisive “Film Socialism” and 2014’s experimental 3D essay “Goodbye to Language” were the only projects with notable American exhibitions, as both screened at the New York Film Festival. The latter was acclaimed, with many critics calling it one of the year’s best. “Language” won a jury prize at Cannes, but a producer accepted on Godard’s behalf.",
            "Two precepts held steady throughout these years: Godard never stopped experimenting with technology or using his platform to challenge the globe’s political strictures.",
            "Amid his spotty mainstream attention over the past few decades, Godard decried the so-called death of quality motion pictures. “I am not an auteur, well, not now, anyways,” he said in 2011. “We once believed we were auteurs, but we weren’t. We had no idea, really. Film is over. It’s sad nobody is really exploring it. But what to do? And anyway, with mobile phones and everything, everyone is now an auteur.”",
            "Sometimes accused of anti-Semitism and often resistant to life as a public figure, Godard went out as a cranky talent who rose to prominence in the age of affluent cinematic misfits. In 2018, he released “Le Livre d’image,” an essay-film full of “Godard’s familiar end-of-civilization motifs,” as a Los Angeles Times critic put it, that focused on the Middle East.",
            "As of 2016, Godard said he still “[hadn’t] started thinking about” how he’d like to be remembered.",
            "“I don’t think I’ve succeeded in making any really good films,” he said. “There are moments, scenes, whole movements that sing. It has all added up to a cinema of sorts, even though I’m still learning my art.”"

            "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Thousands of nurses in Minnesota launched a three-day strike Monday, pressing for salary increases they say will help improve patient care by resolving understaffing stresses that have worsened in the coronavirus pandemic.",
            "Some 15,000 nurses at seven health care systems in the Minneapolis and Duluth areas walked out, a number the union says makes it the largest strike ever by private-sector nurses. The affected hospitals said they have recruited temporary nurses and expected to maintain most services.",
            "Scores of nurses began walking the picket line at 7 a.m. outside Children’s Hospital in Minneapolis, one of 15 hospitals affected. Clad in the red T-shirts of the Minnesota Nurses Association and carrying signs with such slogans as, “Something has got to give,” several said their chief concern was patient safety.",
            "Tracey Dittrich, 50, a registered nurse at the hospital for nearly 24 years, said nurses are tired of “hospital administrators and managers that are telling us to do more.” The hospitals need more nurses and more support staff, and higher pay will help, she said.",
            "“There are shifts where you have three critically ill patients, and you have to decide which patient gets the care, when,” Dittrich said. “I work with people all the time that go home every day and feel horrible because one child had to wait longer for medication, or another child needed to wait longer for an IV. Another child maybe had to wait for a breathing treatment because we just couldn’t get to them all fast enough.”",
            "Union spokesman Sam Fettig said the nurses chose a three-day strike, rather than an open-ended walkout, out of concern for patients.",
            "The hospitals have offered a 10-12% wage increase over three years, but nurses are seeking more than 30%. Hospital leaders called their wage demands unaffordable, noting that Allina and Fairview hospitals have posted operating losses and that the cost of such sharp wage increases would be passed along to patients.",
            "“The union rejected all requests for mediation and held fast to wage demands that were unrealistic, unreasonable and unaffordable,” several of the Twin Cities hospitals under strike said in a joint statement.",
            "The statement said people with emergency issues should continue to call 911 or go to emergency rooms. It said despite staffing hospitals with “experienced nurse managers, trained replacement nurses and some existing traveler nurses” that people may see some delay in being treated.",
            "Jean Ross, co-president of National Nurses United, billed as the largest union and professional association of registered nurses in the U.S., said more nurses across the country are pushing back and that most job actions revolve around the same core issues — staffing and pay.",
            "“The pandemic did so many things in pointing out, clarifying and shining a light on what life is like in the hospitals and what nurses are expected to do, which is a lot with very little,” Ross said. “We have to have a bottom line where you just can’t shove any more patients on to that nurse.”",
            "Kathy Misk, another registered nurse at Children’s, works in case management and helps families transition from hospital care to caring for their child at home. Misk said a shortage of nurses has sometimes required keeping “high-tech” children – those who need special equipment to breathe, for example – from going home as soon as they otherwise could. Raising pay could help the hospital keep nurses on staff, she said.",
            "“You don’t retain nurses with low wages,” Misk said. “When you incentivize nurses with pay, what you’re saying to them is they have worth, and they are able to stay in one job.”",
            "When asked about Misk’s statement that some children have not gone home as soon as they might have, Nick Petersen, a spokesman for Children’s, said children are admitted or discharged “based on the expert judgment of the medical professionals who care for them.”",
            "The hospitals affected by the strike are operated by Allina Health, M Health Fairview, Children’s Hospital, North Memorial and HealthPartners. In Duluth, it is Essentia and St Luke’s.",
            "Separately, in Wisconsin, a potential three-day strike by nurses at UW Health, one of the state’s largest health systems, that was set to start Tuesday was averted when the nurses and the UW Hospital board reached an agreement. Details weren’t immediately released.",
            "The Minnesota nurses’ strike comes amid an upsurge in union activity nationwide.",
            "A national railroad strike could begin as early as Friday unless Congress steps in to block it. The two largest railroad unions have been demanding that the major freight carriers go beyond a proposed deal recommended by arbitrators appointed by President Joe Biden.",
            "Some high-profile companies, including Starbucks, are among those trying to stifle ongoing unionization efforts. Since late last year, more than 230 U.S. Starbucks stores have voted to unionize, which Starbucks opposes.",

            "President Joe Biden urged the nation to come together to fight cancer, the second most common cause of death in America, during an impassioned speech on Monday marking the renewal of his “cancer moonshot.”",
            "Speaking at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston 60 years after the building’s namesake gave his famed moonshot speech, Biden appealed to Americans across political lines, saying the nation was poised to end the disease “as we know it.”",
            "The president harked back to the Kennedy era, comparing the effort to the space race and Americans’ ultimate journey to the moon.",
            "“I believe we can usher in the same unwillingness to postpone, the same national purpose that will serve to energize and measure the best of our skills, to end cancer as we know it, and even cure cancer once and for all,” he said.",
            "The effort aims to slash U.S. fatalities from cancers by 50% over the next quarter century and see many more cancers become chronic conditions that are treatable rather than fatal. Cancer is expected to kill more than 609,000 Americans in 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a toll exceeded only by deaths from heart disease.",
            "Biden added that the plan was “bold, ambitious, and, I might add, completely doable,” pointing to existing technology and the promise of medical advancements.",
            "“This cancer moonshot is one of the reasons why I ran for president,” Biden said. “Cancer does not discriminate red and blue. It doesn’t care if you’re a Republican or a Democrat. Beating cancer is something we can do together.”",
            "Biden announced Dr. Renee Wegrzyn as the inaugural director of a new arm of the government, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, or ARPA-H, on Monday. The body will lead the nation’s efforts in health and biomedical research and “drive breakthroughs to prevent, detect and treat diseases” including cancer, Alzheimer’s and diabetes, the president said.",
            "Biden said he will sign a new executive order ensuring that such treatments are manufactured in America, an effort he said would enable the country to lead “the world in biotechnology and biomanufacturing, creating jobs and strengthening the supply chain.”",
            "“It’s not enough to invent technology that saves lives,” Biden said. “We need to manufacture advanced biotechnologies here in the United States.”",
            "The cancer moonshot was first announced in February, and Biden has long urged the nation to come together to eradicate or ease the burden of the disease.",
            "The president’s son Beau Biden died of brain cancer in 2015."

            "“I’m excited about the candidates that we have overall, because I do believe it gives us the opportunity to win back the majority and to return sanity in Washington, which will reverberate around the country,” Scott said.",
            "Last month, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) cited GOP “candidate quality” as a factor in the election. He acknowledged that the GOP had a greater likelihood of winning control of the House than the Senate.",
            "“Senate races are just different — they’re statewide. Candidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome,” McConnell told reporters.",
            "McConnell’s comments have drawn criticism from factions of his own party, including Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), the head of the Senate GOP campaign arm, who told Politico he and McConnell have a “strategic disagreement” over this.",

            "“If you want to trash-talk our candidates to help the Democrats, pipe down,” the Florida Republican wrote. “That’s not what leaders do. And Republicans need to be leaders that build up the team and do everything they can to get the entire team over the finish line.”",
            "Tim Scott on Sunday also rejected concerns that the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade has energized voters against the GOP in November.",

Entry into the event will be determined by the athlete’s submitted time and the marathon’s overall field size limit. The registration application will include a nonbinary gender option for runners to select.",

            "Varvaro, 37, was an officer for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. He played baseball at St. John’s University in New York City before a career in the majors as a relief pitcher with the Seattle Mariners, Atlanta Braves and Boston Red Sox from 2010 to 2015.",

            "“Not only was he everything you could want out of a ball player, he was everything you could want in a person,” said Hampton, who was an assistant coach at St. John’s during all three of Varvaro’s seasons there. “My heart goes out to his family, friends, teammates and fellow officers.”",
            "Port Authority officials said in a statement that Varvaro “represented the very best of this agency, and will be remembered for his courage and commitment to service.”",

            "Thanks to the upcoming retirement of Rep. Jim Langevin (D), the heavily Democratic state of Rhode Island could be the site of one of the country’s hottest general-election battles in November.",
            "Langevin has represented Rhode Island’s 2nd Congressional District, which encompasses the state’s more conservative and rural western half, since 2001.",
            "President Joe Biden carried the seat by 14 percentage points in 2020, but The Cook Political Report rated the race for the open seat a “toss up” in June.",
            "The contest is expected to be close in no small part because the presumptive Republican nominee to replace Langevin is former Cranston Mayor Allan Fung, a self-described moderate with a history of crossover appeal.",
            "Democrats in Rhode Island will decide on Tuesday between six candidates to take on Fung in the general election: Rhode Island General Treasurer Seth Magaziner; former Langevin aide Joy Fox; former state Rep. David Segal; former Biden Cabinet official Sarah Morgenthau; refugee activist Omar Bah; and former state Rep. Spencer Dickinson.",
            "Fung led all of his potential Democratic challengers in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup, according to a public poll conducted in June shortly before the Supreme Court ruling that overturned the constitutional right to an abortion.",
            "“Allan Fung is not Donald Trump,” said Wendy Schiller, a political scientist at Brown University. “That’s the big challenge for Democrats to hold the seat. Can they convince voters that a vote for Allan Fung is a vote for [House Republican Leader] Kevin McCarthy and a vote for Donald Trump?”",
            "A Democratic Scion Who Switched Races",
            "Magaziner, who boasts the widest array of endorsements and the largest war chest, is the polling favorite.",
            "“Even with undecideds, he’s got enough people who are going to affirmatively try to choose him,” Schiller said. “And increasingly in the last month, Democrats in that district have come to see him as the most competitive against Fung. Those Democrats are persuaded that this seat could give Republicans control of the House.”",
            "Magaziner, who has overseen Rhode Island’s finances since 2014, has deep roots in Democratic politics ― both locally and nationally. Magaziner’s father, Ira, a successful management consultant, is best known for helming President Bill Clinton’s unsuccessful health care reform initiative in 1993 and 1994. Magaziner credits his family’s wealth for enabling him to lend his first campaign for treasurer more than $800,000.",
            "As treasurer, Magaziner endeared himself to Rhode Island’s labor unions with his support for the creation of an infrastructure bank ― and to financial industry donors with his pursuit of aggressive, nontraditional investments for the state’s pension fund. (Magaziner maintains that he was simply seeking the best possible returns for retired state employees.)",
            "Magaziner has also benefited from a head start on fundraising from an abandoned bid for governor that he launched in September 2021. He decided in late January to run for Congress instead, following Langevin’s announcement that he would be retiring.",
            "Relieved not to have to choose between Magaziner and Lt. Gov. Dan McKee in the gubernatorial race, top Democrats, labor unions and other party-aligned groups quickly coalesced behind Magaziner’s congressional bid. The League of Conservation Voters Victory Fund, an environmental super PAC, has spent nearly $400,000 in support of Magaziner’s bid. And Magaziner stands to benefit from the support of Langevin, who endorsed him in June.",
            "Magaziner is running on a relatively conventional Democratic platform. In his TV ads, he has emphasized his support for abortion rights and stricter gun laws, as well as his commitment to protecting Social Security and Medicare.",
            "“I’m running for Congress because I want to make it easier for working people to get ahead and build a good, stable life,” he declared in a Sept. 1 debate.",
            "There are signs, however, that Magaziner would resemble more business-friendly members of the House Democratic Caucus, though not quite to the extent of the party’s most conservative outliers. While he has picked up the endorsement of progressive Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, he’s also been endorsed by Rep. Jake Auchincloss (D-Mass.), a prominent moderate.",
            "Although Magaziner is refusing to accept contributions from political action committees affiliated with the gun, fossil fuel, and pharmaceutical industries, he has not forsworn money from all corporate PACs. And Web3 Forward, a super PAC that advocates for lighter regulation of the cryptocurrency industry, has spent over $162,000 on advertisements supporting Magaziner.",
            "Magaziner has also distinguished himself from his rivals by criticizing Biden’s forgiveness of $10,000 in student debt for Americans earning under $125,000. He has said he prefers to reduce interest rates on loans, but told HuffPost in an interview that he would not vote against Biden’s debt cancellation if it were put to a vote in Congress and it was the only real reform on the table.",
            "“What I’m very concerned about as well is that we fix the underlying structural issues about how higher education is financed, so we don’t end up in the same situation five years from now,” he said.",
            "Alternative Theories Of Electability",
            "Other contenders have made the case that they are more electable against Fung than Magaziner would be. And in the event of an upset loss for Magaziner, Democrats will get a chance to test alternative theories of electability in a state where Democratic congressional candidates are less accustomed to contentious general elections.",
            "Sarah Morgenthau, a former Department of Commerce official under Biden and Department of Homeland Security official under President Barack Obama, has raised the second-largest amount of money after Magaziner. They are the only two candidates who have been able to advertise on television.",
            "Morgenthau, whose mother unsuccessfully sought the seat in 1988, is running more than anything on her identity as a woman and the possibility of becoming the first Democratic woman to represent Rhode Island in Congress. One of her TV ads features the lyrics “Roe, Roe, Roe, your vote” ― a reference to the overturned Roe v. Wade decision that created a constitutional right to abortion ― to the tune of “Row, Row, Row Your Boat.”",
            "“It’s time to stop the fighting and get to work,” she told HuffPost. “That’s what I’ve been about throughout my life and throughout my career.”",
            "Morgenthau said she is the candidate best equipped to beat Fung because, among other things, she is “coming in with a heck of a lot of experience.”",
            "But Morgenthau, a granddaughter of the New Deal-era Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau, has considerable baggage. She owns a summer home in Rhode Island, but only made the state her permanent home recently in order to run for Congress.",
            "“Rhode Island has been my home for 40 years,” Morgenthau insisted during a recent televised Democratic primary debate, noting her mother’s run for Congress in the area over three decades ago. “While my heart is here in Rhode Island, my experience has been everywhere ― and it’s exactly that experience that I will bring to bring back results for folks here in Rhode Island.”",
            "Magaziner has a less striking residency problem of his own, having moved into the district from his former home on the east side of Providence in order to run in Rhode Island’s 2nd.",
            "Magaziner said that his work as treasurer, which included school construction and clean-energy financing plans, have put him in touch with the district’s needs.",
            "“I’ve worked in every city and town in the district to solve problems,” he told HuffPost.",
            "By contrast, Fox ― a political consultant and former local journalist who also worked for former Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo (D), now the U.S. secretary of commerce ― touts her local ties. A resident of Warwick, Fox jokes that she doesn’t commute much beyond her family home in Cranston, where she and her mother are caring for a father with Alzheimer’s disease.",
            "“I grew up in the city [Fung] was mayor of,” Fox said. “I will put my hometown girl against his hometown boy all day long.”",
            "Fox also noted that she was part of the campaign team that helped Raimondo defeat Fung in two consecutive gubernatorial races.",
            "The challenge for Fox is in letting enough Democratic voters know she exists, despite her small budget ― and convincing them she’ll be able to scale up in a competitive race come November.",
            "“You could envision Joy Fox beating Allan Fung with money, because Joy Fox can use the national theme [of beating Republicans] and also claim the mantle of a local Rhode Islander who was born and raised here,” Schiller said.",
            "Omar Bah, a political refugee from Gambia who founded a nonprofit that serves refugees in Providence, is a long-shot candidate who had raised less than $63,000 as of late August.",
            "But he too has an electability case to make, arguing that a failure to nominate him risks ceding a portion of nonwhite voters to Fung, with whom they may identify because he has Chinese ancestry.",
            "“If Allan Fung goes against Seth Magaziner or any other white candidate, he will take a large chunk of people of color from the Democratic Party who otherwise would have voted for me,” Bah told HuffPost.",
            "A Case For Progressive Populism",
            "The policy differences between Magaziner, Fox, Morgenthau and Bah are relatively modest ― and not a major focus of their respective bids.",
            "Dickinson and Segal, by contrast, are making an ideological case, albeit from opposite ends of the spectrum. Dickinson argues that the Democratic Party has moved much too far to the left, prompting centrist and conservative voters to leave the party.",
            "Dickinson has sparse policy material on his campaign website, but he does name “closing” the U.S.-Mexico border as his highest priority.",
            "“If the President won’t do it, then the Congress must,” he declares. “Use the Army if necessary.”",
            "Segal, who founded the advocacy group Demand Progress and is backed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), has carved out the progressive lane in the race, running as a foe of “corporate special interests and political corruption.” Segal’s platform includes the standard array of left-wing policies, including support for Medicare for All and the Green New Deal.",
            "But Segal also emphasizes his record of building bipartisan coalitions for liberal goals like reducing the power of big technology firms and ending U.S. support for the Saudi Arabia-led invasion of Yemen. And he insists that without a populist critique of a rigged economic and political system, Democrats are at a disadvantage against Fung.",
            "“The general election here needs to be taken really seriously,” Segal said. “The way to do that is to nominate somebody who has a 20-year record of taking on outsize corporate power. This is a really popular fight.”",
            "Rhode Island has a history of electing Democrats with socially conservative tendencies. Until recently, many top Democrats in the state legislature supported gun rights and restrictions on abortion access.",
            "Segal nonetheless hopes to appeal to the state’s sizable population of working-class voters, some of whom have shown a receptiveness to a populist message. The state’s Democratic primary voters opted for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential primary. Some of Sanders’ biggest margins were in Warwick and Cranston, key population centers in Rhode Island’s 2nd. Sanders endorsed Segal last Thursday.",
            "What Segal lacks in TV advertising, he could make up for in grassroots support, which carries greater weight in low-turnout races. Segal’s campaign released an internal poll earlier this month that showed him gaining ground on Magaziner. And the Working Families Party has since spent more than $87,000 on paid phone banking and digital ads in support of Segal’s bid.",
            "Finally, the mysterious super PAC Ocean State Forward has emerged as a wild card with a last-minute spending spree in the race’s final days. The group, whose funders and agenda are unknown, has spent more than $102,000 on direct-mail literature attacking Magaziner.",
            "“Seth Magaziner claims to be a progressive Democrat who fights for working families, but he has taken more special interest campaign cash than any candidate for Congress,” one mail item alleges.",
            "Ocean State Forward is run by Democratic political operative Jennifer May. But the attack mirrors the critiques of Magaziner that national Republicans have already made.",
            "“Allan Fung led the Cranston comeback and has proven that one-party rule is hurting Rhode Islanders whose cost of living has surged with Democrats in control,” Samantha Bullock, a spokesperson for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said in a statement. “There couldn’t be a greater contrast between Fung and Silver Spoon Seth Magaziner, whose political career is bankrolled by his rich dad while he works to deliver for his Wall Street friends.”",
            "Regardless of the race’s outcome on Tuesday, national Democrats are preparing to nationalize the general election and paint Fung as a foot soldier for Republican House Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). Fung gave the party some ammunition when he welcomed McCarthy in person to raise money for him in Rhode Island in August. He also attended McCarthy’s national GOP donor retreat in Wyoming later in the month.",
            "Fung, who opposes late-term abortions and public funding for abortions, has said that restricting abortion would not be a priority for him in Congress. “In Rhode Island, they’ve already spoken about this issue,” Fung told The Boston Globe, referring to the state’s codification of abortion rights in 2019. “And I’m not running to try to change the laws on abortion.”",
            "But Fung would not commit to supporting federal legislation codifying abortion rights, which Democrats see as grounds enough to brand him an abortion rights opponent.",
            "“Fung is an anti-abortion empty suit who would be a rubber stamp for Kevin McCarthy’s dangerous agenda to cut Social Security, do Donald Trump’s bidding, and ban abortion nationwide,” James Singer, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, told HuffPost in a statement."

            "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is set to channel John F. Kennedy on the 60th anniversary of JFK’s moonshot speech, highlighting Biden administration efforts aimed at “ending cancer as we know it.”",
            "The president was traveling to Boston on Monday to draw attention to a new federally backed study that seeks to validate using blood tests to screen against multiple cancers — a potential game-changer in diagnostic testing to dramatically improve early detection of cancers. He also planned other announcements meant to better the lives of those suffering from cancer.",
            "His speech at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum comes as Biden seeks to rally the nation around developing treatments and therapeutics for the pervasive diseases that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rank as the second-highest killer of people in the U.S. after heart disease. Biden hopes to move the U.S. closer to the goal he set in February of cutting U.S. cancer fatalities by 50% over the next 25 years and to dramatically improve the lives of caregivers and those suffering from cancer.",
            "Danielle Carnival, the White House cancer moonshot coordinator, told The Associated Press that the administration sees huge potential in the commencement of the blood diagnostic study on identifying and treating cancers.",
            "“One of the most promising technologies has been the development of blood tests that offer the promise of detecting multiple cancers in a single blood test and really imagining the impact that could have on our ability to detect cancer early and in a more equitable way,” Carnival said. “We think the best way to get us to the place where those are realized is to really test out the technologies we have today and see what works and what really has an impact on extending lives.”",
            "In 2022, the American Cancer Society estimates, 1.9 million new cancer cases will be diagnosed and 609,360 people will die of cancer diseases.",
            "The issue is personal to Biden, who lost his adult son Beau in 2015 to brain cancer. After Beau’s death, Congress passed the 21st Century Cures Act, which dedicated $1.8 billion over seven years for cancer research and was signed into law in 2016 by President Barack Obama.",
            "Obama designated Biden, then vice president, to run “mission control” on directing the cancer funds as a recognition of Biden’s grief as a parent and desire to do something about it. Biden wrote in his memoir “Promise Me, Dad” that he chose not to run for president in 2016 primarily because of Beau’s death.",
            "Despite Biden’s attempts to hark back to Kennedy and his space program, the current initiative lacks that same level of budgetary support. The Apollo program garnered massive public investment — more than $20 billion, or more than $220 billion in 2022 dollars adjusted for inflation. Biden’s “moonshot” effort is far more modest and reliant on private sector investment.",
            "Still, Biden has tried to maintain momentum for investments in public health research, including championing the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, modeled after similar research and development initiatives benefiting the Pentagon and intelligence community.",
            "On Monday, Biden will announce Dr. Renee Wegrzyn as the inaugural director of ARPA-H, which has been given the task of studying treatments and potential cures for cancers, Alzheimer’s, diabetes and other diseases. He will also announce a new National Cancer Institute scholars’ program to provide resources to early-career scientists studying treatments and cures for cancer.",
            "In Boston, Biden will also attend an event at Logan International Airport to highlight investments from the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law as well as a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee.",
            "Experts agree it’s far too early to say whether these new blood tests for finding cancer in healthy people will have any effect on cancer deaths. There have been no studies to show they reduce the risk of dying from cancer. Still, they say setting an ambitious goal is important.",
            "Carnival said the National Cancer Institute Study was designed so that any promising diagnostic results could be swiftly put into widespread practice while the longer-term study — expected to last up to a decade — progresses. She said the goal was to move closer to a future where cancers could be detected through routine bloodwork, potentially reducing the need for more invasive and burdensome procedures like colonoscopies, and therefore saving lives.",
            "Scientists now understand that cancer is not a single disease, but hundreds of diseases that respond differently to different treatments. Some cancers have biomarkers that can be targeted by existing drugs that will slow a tumor’s growth. Many more targets await discovery.",
            "“How do we learn what therapies are effective in which subtypes of disease? That to me is oceanic,” said Donald A. Berry, a biostatistician at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. “The possibilities are enormous. The challenges are enormous.”",
            "Despite the challenges, he’s optimistic about cutting the cancer death rate in half over the next 25 years.",
            "“We can get to that 50% goal by slowing the disease sufficiently across the various cancers without curing anybody,” Berry said. “If I were to bet on whether we will achieve this 50% reduction, I would bet yes.”",
            "Even without new breakthroughs, progress can be made by making care more equitable, said Dr. Crystal Denlinger, chief scientific officer for the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, a group of elite cancer centers.",
            "And any effort to reduce the cancer death rate will need to focus on the biggest cancer killer, which is lung cancer. Mostly attributable to smoking, lung cancer now causes more cancer deaths than any other cancer. Of the 1,670 daily cancer deaths in the United States, more than 350 are from lung cancer.",
            "Lung cancer screening is helping. The American Cancer Society says such screening helped drive down the cancer death rate 32% from its peak in 1991 to 2019, the most recent year for which numbers are available.",
            "But only 5% of eligible patients are being screened for lung cancer.",
            "“It’s tragic,” said Dr. Roy Herbst, a lung specialist at Yale Cancer Center.",
            "“The moonshot is going to have to be a social fix as well as a scientific and medical fix,” Herbst said. “We’re going to have to find a way that screening becomes easier, that it’s fully covered, that we have more screening facilities.”",
            "Biden planned to urge Americans who might have delayed cancer screenings during the pandemic to seek them out swiftly, reminding them that early detection can be key to avoiding adverse outcomes.",
            "He was also set to highlight provisions in the Democrats’ healthcare and climate change bill that the administration believes will lower out of pocket drug prices for some widely used cancer treatments. He will also celebrate new guarantees for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits, that cover their potential cancer diagnoses.",
            "Dr. Michael Hassett of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said Biden’s goal to reduce cancer deaths could met by following two parallel paths: one of discovery and the other making sure as many people as possible are reaping the advantages of existing therapies and preventive approaches.",
            "“If we can address both aspects, both challenges, major advances are possible,” Hassett said.",
            "In breast cancer, for example, many women who could benefit from a hormone-blocking pill either never start the therapy or stop taking it before the recommended five years, Hassett’s research has found.",
            "“Those are big gaps,” Hassett said. “That’s a treatment that’s effective. But if many people aren’t taking that medication or if they’re taking it but stopping it before concluding the course of therapy, then the benefits that the medicine could offer aren’t realized.”",

            "This profile is part of our Culture Shifters series, which highlights people who are changing the way we think about the world around us. Read about film archivist Maya Cade, internet stars Keyon Elkins and Drew Afualo, rapper Latashá, music historian Katelina Eccleston, filmmaker Alika Tengan, artist Kay Rufai and actors Rhoyle Ivy King and Nicco Annan.",
            "Ani Liu thinks of her body as a tool — and the subject — of artmaking. In her work, the 36-year-old research-based artist visualizes the emotional experiences she underwent at every stage in her life.",
            "In early 2020, Liu was without childcare for her newborn amid the pandemic while holding on to her full-time job as an artist and a lecturer at Princeton University teaching art classes through the lens of gender, social inequality and technology. More than 3 million women either lost jobs or dropped out of the labor force to take care of their children, according to an analysis by the Census Bureau in spring 2020.",
            "The following year, five days after giving birth to her son in August 2021, Liu had to get back to work. She did not qualify for parental leave policies or maternity leave policies because she had just started a new contract as an associate professor of practice at the University of Pennsylvania Stuart Weitzman School of Design. She had to pump more milk than she directly fed her son.",
            "“This was such an interesting moment where technology and humans are deeply integrated. I feel like I was feeding the machine instead of my son,” Liu said. “The pump can be very liberating when it allows you to remove your body from your baby and pursue whatever you want. But it can be limiting because the technology assumes that it’s feasible for all women to go back into the labor force when they are not.”",
            "These are the kinds of conversations that Liu regularly explores in her exhibitions. She has learned how to disguise her art as science through research and experimentation on sex and gender, female empowerment and how technology confronts our cultural values.",
            "In her latest exhibition “Ecologies of Care,” Liu showcases a series of pieces discussing the labor of mothering, body and politics. In the piece “Labor of Love,” she records every feed and diaper change for the first 30 days after giving birth to her daughter and uses vials filled with breast milk, formula or diaper fragments to mark a feed or a diaper change. The sound of a breast pump circulating milk echoes throughout the gallery space. The volume of milk present in “Untitled (Feeding Through Space and Time)” ranges from the amount produced in a single session of feeding to a month’s supply of lactation.",
            "Liu said the process of lactation is usually stimulated by looking at a baby’s cute face or hearing the baby crying, but since she was pumping so early, the sound of the pump would make her lactate. This experience inspired her to create the pump artwork and made her question how machines play a role in the postpartum period.",
            "Liu created another piece in this series called “The Surrogacy,” which depicts a pig uterus that is pregnant with human fetuses. It is inspired by Aldous Huxley’s dystopian novel “Brave New World” and feminist writer Shulamith Firestone’s argument that growing embryos outside of a mother’s body “can free women from the tyranny of reproduction.” Liu said that though some societies look at the uterus as factories, she thinks that an artificial womb is never a solution to gender inequality.",
            "“I strongly believe that it’s not about technology that can change this issue. There are so many social resources that we could enact, like having paid parental leave or subsidized child care,” Liu said. “If you are going to take away women’s rights to abortion and force women to have babies, there should be [additional ways] to help mothers.”",
            "As she explores her own body now, Liu hopes to create more projects about reproductive bodies and labor rights.",
            "As a first-generation Chinese American immigrant, Liu’s parents barely spoke English when they immigrated to the United States in the early 1980s from Guangzhou. Her father cooked in a Chinese restaurant, and her mother cleaned hotel rooms to support the family. Growing up in Chinatown and the Flushing neighborhood in Queens, Liu was told from an early age that the only way to succeed was to do extremely well in school. Liu knew she had to work really hard to get out of poverty.",
            "Liu genuinely loved school, even though there was a lot of pressure to be the perfect kid. She said learning was an escape from some of the more difficult things she experienced growing up as a Chinese American.",
            "“Strangers would ask me ‘where are you from?’ and when I told them I am from New York City, they will ask ’but where are you really from?’” she said.",
            "Liu studied sculpture and architecture at Dartmouth College and received a master’s degree in architecture at Harvard University. In grad school, she found her passion for art through coding. However, she didn’t know any artists within her family’s circle. On top of that, Liu’s parents told her that art-making can be dangerous; they had witnessed the cultural revolution in China, where the sociopolitical movement led by Chairman Mao Zedong in 1966 imprisoned many artists.",
            "But Liu was determined to pursue her art anyway.",
            "After graduating from Dartmouth College in 2008 during a recession, she stayed at the university and worked as a teaching assistant for the art department, helping facilitate the woodwork and casting studios. She developed her sculpture while being a teaching assistant, proving to her parents that she could still make a living doing what she loves.",
            "Liu’s upbringing has colored how she thinks about her art and career today. At a photo shoot in Flushing in August, Liu suddenly became emotional while sitting at the bus stop where she used to spend two hours waiting on her commute. She said she remembered fighting with her parents frequently about why they lived so far away from school. The memories brought on happy tears when she realized how far she had come.",
            "“I am really grateful for my parents working so hard to achieve the American dream. There were so many barriers for them to achieve the kind of life they wanted for me,” Liu said. “Though it was even harder to live as a Chinese American in the ’80s, I felt almost no negative emotions when I revisited here today.”",
            "Liu still remembers the painfully embarrassing moment when she opened her lunchbox in middle school. She always loved the handmade chive dumplings her mother packed for her, but she hated the way they smelled in front of her white classmates — and how they’d react when she ate them. Sometimes, all she wanted was a ham and cheese sandwich like everyone else.",
            "“Until you go to school, you don’t really realize that you’re so othered,” Liu told me over a cup of coffee in Essex Market in New York City’s Chinatown.",
            "Years later, Liu’s concern about scents and how they are often racialized turned into a larger conversation. In 2018, she created the “Human Perfume” project, which takes the essence of her favorite people and objects and turns them into a wearable fragrance that can spur memories. She became interested in the relationship between race, gender and olfaction.",
            "“I was really interested in what makes the same smell disgusting to one culture and super pleasurable to another culture,” Liu said. “And I was wondering whether through these kinds of sensory forms of communication, [could you] have more empathy or interaction? I was really interested in sensory experiences that were subconscious or subliminal.”",
            "For her next projects, Liu plans to continue her explorations of breastmilk as a cultural material and experiment with data visualization on a molecular level. She is also designing a new course around care, situated within socially engaged art and design.",
            "“Untitled (Pumping)” will be on view at MassArt Art Museum in Boston in a show titled ”Designing Motherhood: Things that Make and Break our Births.″ Additionally, “The Surrogacy” and “Untitled (Feeding Through Space and Time)” will be on view at an upcoming show at MU Hybrid Art House in the Netherlands. Two different editions of “Pregnancy Menswear” will be on display at the grand opening of the MIT Museum, as well as the Kunstmuseum Basel in Switzerland.",
            "“Some people may think the idea of art making is really frivolous and extra because you need to have a certain amount of economic stability before you can do art,” she said. “But I think art is essential to culture.”"

            "Often it’s almost impossible to have a real conversation about a venerable figure amid today’s stan culture — and even sometimes frustratingly discouraged. That’s especially true when it comes to older Black icons who paved the way for those who came after them, and whose less comfortable truths are often pushed aside out of respect.",
            "But director Reginald Hudlin’s “Sidney,” which explores the life and career of the late Sidney Poitier, actually has those conversations. It does so unflinchingly and candidly. And it includes a variety of equally respected heroes of Black cinema who are compelled to reckon with the full portrait of Poitier, a man who both aspired and inspired just as much as he frustrated and disappointed.",
            "We rarely ever really talk about that last part. “Sidney” implores us anyway.",
            "It’s a funny thing too, because for many of us when it was announced that there would be a documentary on Poitier, a few questions immediately sprang to mind: Will it include his affair with “Porgy and Bess” co-star Diahann Carroll, who, like him, was married at the time?",
            "Will it confront the Uncle Tom dialogue that rose during the blaxploitation era that was far less compromising about how Blackness was portrayed on screen? The answer to both these questions is yes and thankfully so.",
            "It’s not about sensationalizing or tarnishing the reputation of a man who burst open the doors of opportunity for Black people in Hollywood and encouraged his contemporaries to advocate for civil rights with figures like Martin Luther King Jr. Rather, it’s about honoring his humanity — every facet of it.",
            "Hudlin is more than equipped for the job. After all, he jumpstarted his career on the heels of Poitier, who intentionally went behind the camera to direct movies by and for Black folks like “A Piece of the Action,” “Let’s Do It Again” and “Uptown Saturday Night” in the ’70s.",
            "Known for helming Black classics like “Boomerang” and “House Party” in the ’90s, Hudlin is likely familiar with the quiet expectation to compromise in a system that usually only celebrates you when you play by its rules.",
            "Hudlin also has the benefit of retrospection when telling the story of “Sidney.” He’s got 30 years in the game and has relevant insight into the system of Hollywood today. But he also understands with compassion what it was like years prior for actors like Poitier.",
            "That’s why so many passages throughout “Sidney” feel so honest and empathetic, while also interrogating and sobering. Hudlin certainly does more than his due diligence by amassing the full scope of Poitier’s life growing up poor in the Bahamas through interviews with the actor as well as archival footage of Poitier reflecting on his experiences.",
            "He ultimately pulled himself up by his bootstraps, moved to Harlem, and bet on his immense talent. There he faced and, in a sense, overcame a whole new set of challenges as a young Black thespian in relentlessly white spaces.",
            "While Poitier earned his stripes from performing in Black spaces like the American Negro Theatre, it wasn’t until white Hollywood took notice that he became immortalized. That’s a fact that catalyzes a lingering question in “Sidney” of where in the zeitgeist Black actors belong once they receive white adoration.",
            "You don’t find an answer in interviews with some of Poitier’s white contemporaries. Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford in the film unequivocally admire him for who he was and for whom he tried to be. But you might be able to come up with your own answer to that by watching some of the clips Hudlin excavates in the film.",
            "Poitier is interviewed by a white male journalist in one scene of archival footage— always a white journalist back then — just when his career is taking off about how he got his start. The interviewer brings up the fact that Poitier was asked to get rid of his “bad native accent was “bad” to get more work. And how did the actor remedy it? He revealed to the interviewer he taught himself by imitating a white guy he saw on screen.",
            "It’s a brief exchange between two men that probably wouldn’t have struck anyone back then because it was expected. But looking back on it now within the story of “Sidney,” it says a lot about the landscape through which Poitier earned his success — and how he even, perhaps subconsciously, sometimes upheld it.",
            "“Sidney” also finds Poitier’s descendants, those who might honor him the most like Halle Berry, Oprah Winfrey, Morgan Freeman, and Spike Lee, wrangling with the complexities of his career while also venerating him. Because, as we too often forget, both things can be done at once.",
            "Harry Belafonte, one of Poitier’s longest friends, who often joined forces with him in the fight for racial justice, doesn’t mince words when talking about their playful professional rivalry (Poitier’s career blew up on the night he stepped in as an understudy on stage for Belafonte).",
            "The two often were up for the same roles but, even more crucially, they disagreed on several political issues that sometimes resulted in them not speaking to each other for years at a time. Belafonte is also open about turning down Poitier’s role in “The Defiant Ones,” because his character, an escaped convict, helps his white, racist fellow convict (Tony Curtis).",
            "In response, Denzel Washington points out something that is not often unacknowledged in these kinds of conversations: opportunity. While Poitier stood up for a lot of things and was very outspoken about issues of racism and other injustices in and beyond Hollywood, he was also a married father of two with financial obligations.",
            "Not everyone, as Washington says, has multiple forms of income to bring home. While Poitier was hustling in Hollywood, Belafonte was also making money on stage, “Dayo-ing.”",
            "But Poitier was well aware of these conversations about him and his film choices. He still stood behind his decisions, while also recognizing the points people made about them. His earnest response was to start a Black production company in the ’70s.",
            "But when, how and whether to confront the role of the Black image on the screen — especially during his time — was trickier to maneuver.",
            "The question of compromise could be asked of any of the Black luminaries Hudlin spoke to in “Sidney” — and for what it’s worth, they’ve all confronted questions about navigating whiteness in Hollywood. Winfrey even openly acknowledged how some Black audiences turned against her for what they saw as catering to white audiences on her hit, self-titled TV show.",
            "It’s what helped bond the two figures. There’s a moment when we see a visibly emotional Winfrey, who like Hudlin is a producer of “Sidney,” dissolve into tears over her love for Poitier as the camera fixates on her for several seconds.",
            "What’s most clear at this moment, though, is how these questions of how Blackness shows up, and for whom, in largely white spaces remain as relevant today as ever. There’s even something to be said about the fact that Poitier was a Black sex symbol, propped up and adored by many Black women, yet he left both his first wife and, ultimately, Carroll to marry a white woman.",
            "“Sidney,” bafflingly, doesn’t even acknowledge this aspect of his personal and romantic life. In a film that explores every other complicated subject around Poitier and the world in which he thrived, this omission by Hudlin and screenwriter Jesse James Miller seems odd.",
            "It’s especially peculiar when you think about it in terms of the long history of Black men choosing white romantic partners after gaining success in white spaces.",
            "There’s certainly no question of whether Poitier loved his widow Joanna Shimkus. Both she and their children, as well as Poitier’s children with first wife Juanita Hardy, are all interviewed in the film and speak highly of his relationship with each of them (with respect to the fact that Poitier cheated on Hardy with Carroll, which understandably devastated her).",
            "They say he also encouraged his children to have relationships with each other, and his biracial kids to understand their identities. Still, that’s the one area of the film that doesn’t feel complete.",
            "But when “Sidney” soars, which is most of the time, it is an absolutely satisfying portrait of a man who gave us so much within the confines of a system that was making up new rules for his unprecedented success as he went along, and the complex ways in which he responded to that.",
            "“Sidney” doesn’t bother to simplify details around Poitier’s biography, nor does it try to complicate his story. Rather, it honors the very real complexities of the life he lived.",
            "“Sidney” premiered at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival, and will be released on Apple TV Plus on Sept. 23."

            "Alcaraz is a Spaniard who was appearing in his eighth major tournament and second at Flushing Meadows but already has attracted plenty of attention as someone considered the Next Big Thing in men’s tennis.",
            "He was serenaded by choruses of “Olé, Olé, Olé! Carlos!” that reverberated off the closed roof at Arthur Ashe Stadium — and Alcaraz often motioned to the supportive spectators to get louder.",
            "He only briefly showed signs of fatigue from having to get through three consecutive five-setters to reach the title match, something no one had done in New York in 30 years.",
            "Alcaraz dropped the second set and faced a pair of set points while down 6-5 in the third. But he erased each of those point-from-the-set opportunities for Ruud with the sorts of quick-reflect, soft-hand volleys he repeatedly displayed.",
            "And with help from a series of shanked shots by a tight-looking Ruud in the ensuing tiebreaker, Alcaraz surged to the end of that set.",
            "One break in the fourth was all it took for Alcaraz to seal the victory in the only Grand Slam final between two players seeking both a first major championship and the top spot in the ATP’s computerized rankings, which date to 1973.",
            "Ruud is a 23-year-old from Norway who is now 0-2 in Slam finals. He was the runner-up to Rafael Nadal at the French Open in June.",

            "The Mosquito Fire in foothills east of Sacramento spread to nearly 65 square miles (168 square kilometers), with 10% containment, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire.",
            "“Cooler temperatures and higher humidity assisted with moderating some fire activity,” but higher winds allowed the flames to push to the north and northeast, according to a Cal Fire incident report Sunday.",
            "More than 5,800 structures in Placer and El Dorado counties were under threat and some 11,000 residents of communities including Foresthill and Georgetown were under evacuation orders.",
            "In Southern California, cooler temperatures and rain brought respite to firefighters battling the massive Fairview Fire about 75 miles (121 kilometers) southeast of Los Angeles after sweltering heat last week.",
            "The 44-square-mile (114-square-kilometer) blaze was 45% contained Sunday. The fire has destroyed at least 30 homes and other structures in Riverside County. Two people died while fleeing flames last Monday.",
            "A helicopter assisting with operations in the Fairview Fire crashed in a residential backyard while attempting to land at a local airport Saturday afternoon, fire officials said. Injuries to the pilot and two others were not critical.",
            "The southern part of the state welcomed the cooler weekend weather as a tropical storm veered off the Pacific Coast and faded, helping put an end to blistering temperatures that nearly overwhelmed the state’s electrical grid.",
            "Thunderstorms and the risk of flooding persisted in mountainous areas of greater Los Angeles on Sunday. But after Hurricane Kay made landfall in Mexico last week it quickly was downgraded and weakened further until it largely disappeared, forecasters said.",
            "To the north, remnants of Kay caused flooding Saturday that stranded about 40 vehicles and closed a stretch of State Route 190 in Death Valley National Park. The park was still cleaning up from floods five weeks ago that closed many key roads.",
            "In Washington state, fire officials were scrambling to secure resources in the battle against a blaze sparked Saturday in the remote Stevens Pass area that sent hikers fleeing and forced evacuations of mountain communities. There was no containment Sunday of the Bolt Creek Fire, which had scorched nearly 12 square miles (31 square kilometers) of forestland about an hour and a half east of Seattle.",
            "“The fire will continue to advance in areas that will be unstaffed. With limited resources, only point protection will be in place while resources continue to mobilize to the fire,” said a Sunday morning incident report.",
            "California’s Mosquito Fire has covered a large portion of the Northern Sierra region with smoke. California health officials urged people in affected areas to stay indoors where possible. Organizers of the Tour de Tahoe canceled the annual 72-mile (115-km) bicycle ride scheduled Sunday around Lake Tahoe because of the heavy smoke from the blaze — more than 50 miles (80 km) away. Last year’s ride was canceled because of smoke from another big fire south of Tahoe.",
            "The Mosquito Fire’s cause remained under investigation. Pacific Gas & Electric said unspecified “electrical activity” occurred close in time to the report of the fire on Tuesday.",
            "Scientists say climate change has made the West warmer and drier over the last three decades and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive. In the last five years, California has experienced the largest and most destructive fires in state history.",
            "And the rest of the West hasn’t been immune. There were at least 18 large fires burning in Oregon and Washington, leading to evacuations and targeted power outages near Portland as the challenge of dry and windy conditions continued in the region.",
            "Sprawling areas of western Oregon choked by thick smoke from the fires in recent days were expected to see improved air quality on Sunday thanks to a returning onshore flow, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported.",
            "South of Portland, more than 3,000 residents were under new evacuation orders because of the 134-square-mile (347-square-kilometer) Cedar Creek Fire, which has burned for over a month across Lane and Deschutes counties. Firefighters were protecting remote homes in Oakridge, Westfir and surrounding mountain communities.",
            "According to the Northwest Interagency Coordination Center, this weekend there were more than 400 square miles (1,035 square kilometers) of active, uncontained fires and nearly 5,000 people on the ground fighting them in the two northwestern states."

            "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden marked the 21st anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, taking part in a somber wreath-laying ceremony at the Pentagon held under a steady rain and paying tribute to “extraordinary Americans” who gave their lives on one of the nation’s darkest days.",
            "Sunday’s ceremony occurred a little more than a year after Biden ended the long and costly war in Afghanistan that the U.S. and allies launched in response to the terror attacks.",
            "Biden noted that even after the United States left Afghanistan that his administration continues to pursue those responsible for the 9/11 attacks. Last month, Biden announced the U.S. had killed Ayman al-Zawahri, the al-Qaida leader who helped plot the Sept. 11 attacks, in a clandestine operation.",
            "“We will never forget, we will never give up,” Biden said. “Our commitment to preventing another attack on the United States is without end.”",
            "The president was joined by family members of the fallen, first responders who had been at the Pentagon on the day of the attack, as well as Defense Department leadership for the annual moment of tribute carried out in New York City, the Pentagon and Somerset County, Pennsylvania.",
            "In ending the Afghanistan war, the Democratic president followed through on a campaign pledge to bring home U.S. troops from the country’s longest conflict. But the war concluded chaotically in August 2021, when the U.S.-backed Afghan government collapsed, a grisly bombing killed 170 Afghans and 13 U.S. troops at Kabul’s airport, and thousands of desperate Afghans gathered in hopes of escape before the final U.S. cargo planes departed over the Hindu Kush.",
            "Biden marked the one-year anniversary of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan late last month in low-key fashion. He issued a statement in honor of the 13 U.S. troops killed in the bombing at the Kabul airport and spoke by phone with U.S. veterans assisting ongoing efforts to resettle in the United States Afghans who helped the war effort.",
            "Biden on Sunday said an “incredible debt” was owed to the U.S. troops who served in Afghanistan as well as their families. More than 2,200 U.S. service members were killed and more than 20,000 were wounded over the course of the nearly 20-year war, according to the Pentagon.",
            "He also vowed that the nation will “never fail to meet the sacred obligation to you to properly prepare and equip those that we send into harm’s way and care for those and their families when they come home — and to never, ever, ever forget.”",
            "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday criticized Biden’s handling of the end of the war and noted that the country has spiraled downward under renewed Taliban rule since the U.S. withdrawal.",
            "“Now, one year on from last August’s disaster, the devastating scale of the fallout from President Biden’s decision has come into sharper focus,” McConnell said. “Afghanistan has become a global pariah. Its economy has shrunk by nearly a third. Half of its population is now suffering critical levels of food insecurity.”",
            "The president also remembered the words of comfort Queen Elizabeth II, who died last week, sent to the American people soon after the 2001 attacks: “Grief is the price we pay for love.” Biden said those words remain as poignant as they did 21 years ago but the weight of loss also remains heavy.",
            "“On this day, when the price feels so great, Jill and I are holding all of you close to our hearts.” Biden said.",
            "Biden has recently dialed up warnings about what he calls the “extreme ideology” of former President Donald Trump and his “MAGA Republican” adherents as a threat to American democracy. Without naming Trump, Biden again on Sunday raised a call for Americans to safeguard democracy.",
            "“It’s not enough to stand up for democracy once a year or every now and then,” Biden said. “It’s something we have to do every single day. So this is a day not only to remember, but also is a day for renewal and resolve for each and every American in our devotion to this country, to the principles it embodies, to our democracy.”",
            "First lady Jill Biden spoke to a crowd at the Flight 93 National Memorial Observance in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where she recalled the concern she had about her sister Bonny Jacobs, a United Airlines flight attendant.",
            "She said the attacks showed that “with courage and kindness we can be a light in that darkness.”",
            "“It showed us that we are all connected to one another,” said Biden, who was joined by her sister in Shanksville for Sunday’s commemoration. “So as we stand on this sacred and scarred earth, a record of our collective grief and a monument to the memories that live on each day, this is the legacy we much carry forward: Hope that defies hate.”",

            "NEW YORK (AP) — Americans remembered 9/11 on Sunday with tear-choked tributes, and pleas to “never forget,” 21 years after the deadliest terror attack on U.S. soil.",
            "Bonita Mentis set out to read victims’ names at the ground zero ceremony wearing a necklace with a photo of her slain sister, Shevonne Mentis, a 25-year-old Guyanese immigrant who worked for a financial firm.",
            "“It’s been 21 years, but it’s not 21 years for us. It seems like just yesterday,” Mentis said. “The wounds are still fresh.”",
            "“No matter how many years have passed, nobody can actually comprehend that what happened that very day,” she added.",
            "Victims’ relatives and dignitaries also convened at the other two attack sites, the Pentagon and a field in Pennsylvania.",
            "More than two decades later, Sept. 11 remains a point for reflection on the hijacked-plane attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people, reconfigured national security policy and spurred a U.S. “war on terror” worldwide. Sunday’s observances, which follow a fraught milestone anniversary last year, come little more than a month after a U.S. drone strike killed a key al-Qaida figure who helped plot the 9/11 attacks, Ayman al-Zawahri.",
            "Pierre Roldan, who lost his cousin Carlos Lillo, a paramedic, said “we had some form of justice” when a U.S. raid killed Osama bin Laden in 2011.",
            "“Now that Al-Zawahri is gone, at least we’re continuing to get that justice,” Roldan said.",
            "The Sept. 11 attacks also stirred — for a time — a sense of national pride and unity for many, while subjecting Muslim Americans to years of suspicion and bigotry and engendering debate over the balance between safety and civil liberties. In ways both subtle and plain, the aftermath of 9/11 ripples through American politics and public life to this day.",
            "But like some other victims’ relatives, Jay Saloman fears that Americans’ consciousness of 9/11 is receding.",
            "“It was a terrorist attack against our country that day. And theoretically, everybody should remember it and, you know, take precautions and watch out,” said Saloman, who lost his brother.",
            "Like a growing number of those who read names at ground zero, firefighter Jimmy Riches’ namesake nephew wasn’t born yet when his relative died. But the boy took the podium to honor him.",
            "“You’re always in my heart. And I know you are watching over me,” he said after reading a portion of the victims’ names.",
            "More than 70 of Sekou Siby’s co-workers perished at Windows on the World, the restaurant atop the trade center’s north tower. Siby had been scheduled to work that morning until another cook asked him to switch shifts.",
            "The Ivorian immigrant wrestled with how to comprehend such horror in a country where he’d come looking for a better life. And he found it difficult to form friendships as close as those he’d had at Windows on the World. It was too painful, he’d learned, to become attached to people when “you have no control over what’s going to happen to them next.”",
            "“Every 9/11 is a reminder of what I lost that I can never recover,” Siby said in the leadup to the anniversary. He’s now president and CEO of ROC United, a restaurant workers’ advocacy group that evolved from a post-9/11 relief center.",
            "Speaking at the Pentagon on Sunday, President Joe Biden recalled seeing smoke rise from the stricken U.S. military headquarters on 9/11, when he was a senator. He vowed that the U.S. would continue working to root out terrorist plots and called on Americans to stand up for democracy on days beyond the anniversary.",
            "“We have an obligation, a duty, a responsibility to defend, preserve and protect our democracy — the very democracy that guarantees the right to freedom that those terrorists on 9/11 sought to bury in the burning fire, smoke and ash,” the Democrat said.",
            "First lady Jill Biden was scheduled to speak in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where one of the hijacked planes went down after passengers and crew members tried to storm the cockpit as the hijackers headed for Washington. Al-Qaida conspirators had seized control of the jets to use them as passenger-filled missiles.",
            "Vice President Kamala Harris and husband Doug Emhoff joined the observance at the National Sept. 11 Memorial in New York, but by tradition, no political figures speak. The observance centers instead on victims’ relatives reading aloud the names of the dead.",
            "Nikita Shah headed there in a T-shirt that bore the de facto epigraph of the annual commemoration — “never forget” — and the name of her slain father, Jayesh Shah.",
            "The family later moved to Houston but often returns to New York for the anniversary to be “around people who kind of experienced the same type of grief and the same feelings after 9/11,” said Shah. She was 10 when her father was killed.",
            "Readers often add personal remarks that form an alloy of American sentiments about Sept. 11 — grief, anger, toughness, appreciation for first responders and the military, appeals to patriotism, hopes for peace, occasional political barbs, and a poignant accounting of the graduations, weddings, births and daily lives that victims have missed.",
            "Some relatives also lament that a nation which came together — to some extent — after the attacks has since splintered apart. So much so that federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies, which were reshaped to focus on international terrorism after 9/11, now see the threat of domestic violent extremism as equally urgent.",
            "“It took a tragedy to unite us. It should not take another tragedy to unite us again,” said Andrew Colabella, whose cousin, John DiGiovanni, died in the 1993 bombing World Trade Center bombing that presaged 9/11.",
            "Beyond the attack sites, other communities around the country marked the day with candlelight vigils, interfaith services and other commemorations. Some Americans joined in volunteer projects on a day that is federally recognized as both Patriot Day and a National Day of Service and Remembrance."

            "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Europe’s largest nuclear plant has been reconnected to Ukraine’s electricity grid, allowing engineers to shut down its last operational reactor in an attempt to avoid a radiation disaster as fighting rages in the area.",
            "The six-reactor Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant lost its outside source of power a week ago after all its power lines were disconnected because of shelling. It was operating in “island mode” for several days, generating electricity for crucial cooling systems from its only remaining operational reactor.",
            "That’s considered an unstable way of operating a nuclear plant, which could lead to damage to key equipment including turbines and pumps.",
            "Nuclear operator Energoatom said one of the power lines was restored “to its operational capacity” late Saturday, making it possible to run the plant’s safety and other systems on electricity from the power system of Ukraine.",
            "“Therefore, a decision was made to shut down power unit No. 6 and transfer it to the safest state – cold shutdown,” the company said Sunday in a statement.",
            "Energoatom said the risk remains high that outside power is cut again, in which case the plant would have to fire up emergency diesel generators to keep the reactors cool and prevent a nuclear meltdown. The company’s chief told The Associated Press on Thursday that the plant only has diesel fuel for 10 days.",
            "The plant, one of the 10 biggest atomic power stations in the world, has been occupied by Russian forces since early in the war, which marked its 200th day on Sunday. Ukraine and Russia have blamed each other for shelling around the plant that has damaged the power lines connecting it to the grid.",
            "Energoatom renewed its appeal for Russian forces to leave the Zaporizhzhia plant and allow for the creation of a “demilitarized zone” around it.",
            "The International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog that has two experts at the plant, confirmed that external power has been restored there.",
            "However, IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi said he remains “gravely concerned about the situation at the plant, which remains in danger as long as any shelling continues.”",
            "He added that “consultations have begun on the urgent need to establish a nuclear safety and security protection zone” at the plant.",
            "The IAEA said it would take 30 hours to bring the sixth reactor to a “cold shutdown state,” but it will still require electricity for its safety systems after that. The agency said work is under way to restore other power lines at the plant, which remains occupied by Russian forces but run by Ukrainian engineers.",
            "Also on Sunday, French President Emmanuel Macron urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to withdraw his troops and weapons from the plant and ensure its safety and security in line with IAEA recommendations.",

            "NEW YORK (AP) — Payment processor Visa Inc. said late Saturday that it plans to start separately categorizing sales at gun shops.",
            "It’s a major win for gun control advocates who say it will help better track suspicious surges of gun sales that could be a prelude to a mass shooting. But gun rights advocates have argued that step would unfairly segregate legal gun sales when most sales do not lead to mass shootings.",
            "Visa said it would adopt the International Organization for Standardization’s new merchant code for gun sales, which was announced on Friday. Until Friday, gun store sales were considered “general merchandise.”",
            "Visa’s adoption is significant as the largest payment network, and will likely add pressure for Mastercard and American Express to adopt the code as well.",
            "Gun control advocates had gotten significant wins on this front in recent weeks. New York City officials and pension funds had pressured the ISO and banks to adopt this code.",
            "Two of the country’s largest public pension funds, in California and New York, are pressing the country’s largest credit card firms to establish sales codes specifically for firearm-related sales that could flag suspicious purchases or more easily trace how guns and ammo are sold.",
            "Merchant Category Codes now exist for almost every kind of purchase, including those made at supermarkets, clothing stores, coffee shops and many other retailers.",
            "“When you buy an airline ticket or pay for your groceries, your credit card company has a special code for those retailers. It’s just common sense that we have the same policies in place for gun and ammunition stores,” said New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a former police captain who blames the proliferation of guns for his city’s deadly violence.",
            "The city’s comptroller, Brad Lander, said it made moral and financial sense as a tool to push back against gun violence.",
            "“Unfortunately, the credit card companies have failed to support this simple, practical, potentially lifesaving tool. The time has come for them to do so,” Lander said recently, before Visa’s announcement.",
            "Landers is a trustee of the New York City Employees’ Retirement System, Teachers’ Retirement System and Board of Education Retirement System — which together own 667,200 shares in American Express valued at approximately $92.49 million; 1.1 million shares in MasterCard valued at approximately $347.59 million; and 1.85 million shares in Visa valued at approximately $363.86 million.",
            "In letters to the companies, the New York pensions funds, joined by the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, sought support for such a move, saying the companies have a responsibility to prohibit the use of their networks for what public officials deemed illegal activity.",
            "“Failing to do so can result in regulatory, reputational, and litigation risks that may harm long-term shareholder value,” the letters asserted.",
            "Over the years, public pension funds have used their extensive investment portfolios to influence public policy and the market place.",
            "The California teacher’s fund, the second largest pension fund in the country, has long taken aim on the gun industry. It has divested its holdings from gun manufacturers and has sought to persuade some retailers from selling guns.",
            "Four years ago, the teacher’s fund made guns a key initiative. It called for background checks and called on retailers “monitor irregularities at the point of sale, to record all firearm sales, to audit firearms inventory on a regular basis, and to proactively assist law enforcement.”",
            "The pension funds argue that creating a merchant category code for standalone firearm and ammunition stores could aid in the battle against gun violence.",
            "In letters to the credit card companies, a pattern of purchases could flag suspicious activity.",
            "Officials said that a week before the mass shooting at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida, where 49 people died after a shooter opened fire in 2016, the assailant used credit cards to purchase more than $26,000 worth of guns and ammunition, including purchases at a stand-alone gun retailer.",

            "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department and Donald Trump’s legal team proposed candidates Friday for the role of an independent arbiter in the investigation into top-secret documents found at the former president’s Florida home, but the two sides differed on the scope of duties the person would have.",
            "Lawyers for Trump said they believe the so-called special master should review all documents seized by the FBI during its search last month of Mar-a-Lago, including records with classification markings, and filter out any that may be protected by claims of executive privilege.",
            "The Justice Department said it does not believe the arbiter should be permitted to inspect classified records or to take into account potential claims of executive privilege.",
            "U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon had given both sides until Friday to submit potential candidates for the role of a special master, as well as proposals for the scope of the person’s duties and the schedule for his or her work.",
            "The Justice Department submitted the names of two retired judges — Barbara Jones, who served on the federal bench in Manhattan and performed the same role in prior high-profile investigations, and Thomas Griffith, a former federal appeals court jurist in the District of Columbia.",
            "The Trump team proposed one retired judge, Raymond Dearie — also the former top federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of New York — and prominent Florida lawyer Paul Huck Jr.",
            "The back-and-forth over the special master is playing out amid an FBI investigation into the retention of several hundred classified documents recovered from Mar-a-Lago within the past year. Though the legal wrangling is unlikely to have major long-term effects on the criminal investigation or knock it significantly off course, it will almost certainly delay it and has already caused the intelligence community to temporarily pause a national risk assessment.",
            "Over the strenuous objections of the Justice Department, Cannon on Monday granted the Trump team’s request for the special master and directed the department to temporarily halt its review of records for investigative purposes.",
            "She said the person would be responsible for sifting through the records recovered during the Aug. 8 search of Mar-a-Lago and filtering out any documents potentially covered by claims of attorney-client or executive privilege.",
            "Roughly 11,000 documents — including more than 100 with classified markings, some at the top-secret level — were recovered during the search. That’s on top of classified documents contained in 15 boxes retrieved in January by the National Archives and Records Administration, and additional sensitive government records the department took back during a June visit to Mar-a-Lago.",
            "The Justice Department had objected to the Trump team’s request for a special master, saying it had already completed its own review in which identified a limited subset of records that possibly involve attorney-client privilege. It has maintained that executive privilege does not apply in this investigation because Trump, no longer president, had no right to claim the documents as his.",
            "The department on Thursday filed a notice of appeal indicating that it would contest the judge’s order to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. Officials asked the judge to lift her hold on their investigative work pending their appeal, as well as her requirement that the department share with a special master the classified records that were recovered.",
            "It is not clear whether Trump or anyone else will be charged.",

            "Thirteen years after “Avatar” hit theaters and became the highest-grossing film of all time, James Cameron is back for more.",
            "The director presented new footage Saturday of its sequel, “Avatar: The Way Of Water,” at Disney’s D23 Expo, according to AV Club. With three additional entries to the franchise in the works, Cameron was particularly delighted to finally showcase new scenes from the upcoming film.",
            "“I’m super excited to be finally finishing up movie two,” Cameron told the audience. “I know everyone’s been waiting a long time. Hopefully, we’ll show something today and you can decide if it’s been worth it.”",
            "The presentation showcased five or six scenes from the film, which the audience experienced with 3D glasses. The underwater sequences reportedly dazzled the crowd as viewers returned to the fictional world of Pandora.",
            "The original film, which saw the United States Marines invade an alien species named the Na’vi, broke box office records and has since grossed nearly $3 billion. Film critics like The Observer’s Philip French called the 2009 movie “overlong, dramatically two-dimensional, smug and simplistic.”",
            "As for the length of the sequel, Cameron recently said he doesn’t want anybody criticizing its three-hour runtime.",
            "“I don’t want anybody whining about length when they sit and binge-watch [television] for eight hours,” he told Empire in July. “I can almost write this part of the review. ‘The agonizingly long three-hour movie…’ It’s like, give me a fucking break. I’ve watched my kids sit and do five one-hour episodes in a row.”",
            "Director Liam O’Donnell, who wrote the alien invasion science-fiction film “Skyline,” took to Twitter after watching Cameron’s presentation of “The Way of Water” footage in August. It “appears to be the most insanely complicated movie ever made” and it “broke brain,” he said",
            "“Just the amount of data they captured,” O’Donnell tweeted. “Underwater performance capture with 15 cameras. Two cams on every actor’s face capture. Underwater reference capture for fully CG creatures. Oh yeah, and infrared depth capture to place CG characters in the live-action footage.”",
            "Over the years, “Avatar” has become a cultural phenomenon, spurring annual Halloween costumes of the blue-skinned protagonists and a humorous presentation by Ben Stiller at the 2010 Academy Awards.",
            "“The Way of Water” is set for release in theaters on Dec. 16."

            "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia’s Defense Ministry announced Saturday that it’s pulling back troops from two areas in Ukraine’s eastern Kharkiv region where a Ukrainian counteroffensive has made significant advances in the past week.",
            "The news came after days of apparent advances by Ukraine south of Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city, in what could become the biggest battlefield success for Ukrainian forces since they thwarted a Russian attempt to seize the capital of Kyiv at the start of the nearly seven-month war.",
            "Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said Saturday that troops would be regrouped from the Balakliya and Izyum areas to Ukraine’s tern Donetsk region. Izyum was a major base for Russian forces in the Kharkiv region and earlier this week social media videos showed residents of Balakliya joyfully cheering as Ukrainian troops moved in.",
            "Konashenkov said the Russian move is being made “in order to achieve the stated goals of the special military operation to liberate Donbas,’” one of the eastern Ukraine regions that Russia has declared sovereign.",
            "The claim of pullback to concentrate on Donetsk is similar to the justification Russia gave for pulling back its forces from the Kyiv region earlier this year when they failed to take the Ukrainian capital.",
            "Ukrainian officials earlier Saturday claimed major gains in a counteroffensive against Russian forces in the Kharkiv region, saying Ukrainian troops had cut off vital supplies to Izyum.",
            "Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleh Nikolenko also suggested the Ukrainian troops had retaken Kupiansk, a town along the main supply route to Izyum, long a focus on the Russian front line and the site of heavy artillery and other fighting. Nikolenko tweeted a photo showing soldiers in front of what he said was a government building in Kupiansk, 73 kilometers (45 miles) north of Izyum.",
            "The Ukrainian Security Service of Ukraine hours later posted a message which it said showed its forces in Kupiansk, further suggesting it had been seized by Ukrainian troops. The Ukrainian military didn’t immediately confirm entering the town, a railway hub that Russia seized in February.",
            "Videos on social media appeared to show Ukrainian forces on the outskirts of Izyum at a roadside checkpoint. A large statue with the city’s name could be seen in the footage. Ukrainian forces did not acknowledge holding the city.",
            "Earlier Saturday, the British Defense Ministry told reporters it believed the Ukrainians had advanced as much as 50 kilometers (30 miles) south of Kharkiv, and described Russian forces around Izyum as “increasingly isolated.”",
            "“Russian forces were likely taken by surprise. The sector was only lightly held and Ukrainian units have captured or surrounded several towns,” the British military said, adding that the loss of Kupiansk would greatly affect Russian supply lines.",
            "The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, likewise referenced sweeping Ukrainian gains, estimating that Kyiv has seized around 2,500 square kilometers (965 square miles) in its eastern breakthrough. The institute said it appeared that “disorganized Russian forces (were) caught in the rapid Ukrainian advance.” They cited social media images of apparent Russian prisoners seized in the advance around Izyum and surrounding towns.",
            "The same report said Ukrainian forces “may collapse Russian positions around Izyum if they sever Russian ground lines of communication” north and south of the town.",
            "Vladislav Sokolov, head of the Russian-appointed local administration, said on social media that authorities in Izyum have started evacuating residents to Russia.",
            "The fighting in eastern Ukraine comes amid an ongoing offensive around Kherson in the south. Analysts suggest Russia may have taken soldiers from the east to reinforce around Kherson, offering the Ukrainians the opportunity to strike a weakened front line.",
            "Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov told the television channel Ukraina that the Russians had no food or fuel for their troops in the area as Kyiv had cut off their supply lines.",
            "“It will be like an avalanche,” he said, predicting a Russian fallback. “One line of defense will shake and it will fall.”",
            "The Ukrainian military was more circumspect about the reported gains, claiming Saturday to have taken “more than 1,000 square kilometers” (386 square miles) from pro-Kremlin forces this week. It said “in some areas, units of the Defense Forces have penetrated the enemy’s defenses to a depth of 50 kilometers,” matching the British assessment, but did not disclose geographical details.",
            "Officials in Kyiv have for weeks been tight-lipped about plans for a counteroffensive to retake territory overrun by Russia early in the war, urging residents to refrain from sharing information on social media.",
            "However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday that Ukrainian troops had reclaimed more than 30 settlements in the Kharkiv region since the start of the counteroffensive.",
            "“We are gradually taking control over more settlements, returning the Ukrainian flag and protection for our people,” Zelenskyy said.",
            "He spoke after the Ukrainian governor of Kharkiv reported that the national flag had been raised over Balakliya, a town recaptured by Ukrainian troops on Thursday following six months of Russian occupation.",
            "“Balakliya is Ukraine! Today, together with the military, led by the commander of the Ground Forces Oleksandr Syrskyy, we raised the Ukrainian flag,” governor Oleh Syniehubov wrote on Telegram.",
            "Elsewhere, Ukrainian emergency services reported that a 62-year-old woman was killed in a Russian missile strike in the Kharkiv region when her home was flattened overnight.",
            "Syniehubov also accused Moscow of pummeling settlements retaken by Kyiv. He said in a Telegram post that five civilians were hospitalized in the Izyum district, while nine others suffered injuries elsewhere in the region.",
            "In the embattled Donbas region south of Kharkiv, the Ukrainian governor said civilians were killed and wounded overnight by Russian shelling near the city of Bakhmut, a key target of the stalled Russian offensive there. Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Telegram that two people died and two more suffered injuries in Bakhmut and the neighboring village of Yahidne.",
            "Meanwhile, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock arrived in Kyiv on an unannounced visit Saturday, saying that Europe would not tire of helping Ukraine despite Russian President Vladimir Putin’s efforts to raise the pressure by withholding energy supplies from European Union nations.",
            "Baerbock said Germany will assist Ukraine in finding and removing mines and other unexploded ordnance left by Russian troops in areas where they have been pushed back by Ukrainian forces.",
            "Despite the gains made by Ukraine’s armed forces, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the head of NATO warned Friday that Ukraine’s fight against Russia appears set to drag on for months. Blinken said the war was entering a critical period and urged Ukraine’s Western backers to keep up their support through what could be a difficult winter.",

            "SAN DIEGO (AP) — Parts of Southern California were lashed by severe winds from a tropical storm Friday that brought high humidity, rain and possible flooding to the parched region but also the promise of cooler temperatures after a 10-day heat wave that nearly overwhelmed the state’s electrical grid.",
            "Firefighters had feared powerful winds that topped 100 mph (161 kph) could expand the massive Fairview Fire burning about 75 miles (121 kilometers) southeast of Los Angeles but instead crews made significant progress and pegged Monday as a day when they should have full containment. More than 10,000 homes and other structures remained threatened and evacuation orders were still in place.",
            "Hurricane Kay made landfall near Mexico’s Bahia Asuncion in Baja California Sur state Thursday, but it quickly weakened into a tropical storm by the time it reached Southern California. Still winds, were ferocious in places — speeds reached 109 mph (175 kph) on San Diego County’s Cuyamaca Peak, the National Weather Service said.",
            "The tropical conditions added a swelter to the heat wave that saw temperatures soar past 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) in many parts of California this week. Even places like San Diego, renowned for its temperate climate, baked in the heat.",
            "By late morning Friday a steady rain pelted downtown San Diego as Charles Jenkins swept the accumulating puddles away from the tarps of his makeshift home.",
            "“The heat was killer, so for now this feels good,” Jenkins said. “I just hope the water doesn’t get too high. But I will rough it. I’ve got pallets I can put underneath to keep out the rain.”",
            "Around 1 p.m. as rain continued, a Navy-contracted, twin-engine plane carrying two civilian pilots slid off the end of a runway after it touched down at Naval Air Station North Island in Coronado and parked in a spit of sand. The plane’s nose was damaged but the pilots were able to depart on their own and were taken to a hospital for observation, Naval Base Coronado spokesperson Kevin Dixon said.",
            "Though rainfall generally was moderate across Southern California Friday there was a chance of isolated thunderstorms and heavy downpours into Saturday. With flooding possible, officials in coastal cities posted warning signs in low-lying areas and made sandbags available to the public.",
            "September already has produced one of the hottest and longest heat waves on record for California and some other Western states. Nearly 54 million people were under heat warnings and advisories across the region this week as temperature records were shattered in many areas.",
            "California’s state capital of Sacramento hit an all-time high Tuesday of 116 degrees (46.7 C), breaking a 97-year-old record. Salt Lake City tied its all-time high temperature Wednesday at 107 degrees (41.6 C).",
            "On Tuesday, as air conditioners whirred amid the stifling heat, California set a record for power consumption and authorities nearly instituted rolling blackouts when the electrical grid capacity was at its breaking point.",
            "Scientists say climate change has made the West warmer and drier over the last three decades and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive. In the last five years, California has experienced the largest and most destructive fires in state history.",
            "While firefighters made progress against the Fairview Fire, the fast-moving Mosquito Fire in the foothills east of Sacramento doubled in size Friday to at least 46 square miles (119 square kilometers) and threatened 3,600 homes in Placer and El Dorado counties, while blanketing the region in smoke.",
            "Flames jumped the American River, burning structures in the mountain hamlet of Volcanoville and moving closer to the towns of Foresthill, home to about 1,500 people, and Georgetown, population 3,000. More than 5,700 people in the area have been evacuated, said Placer County Sheriff’s Office Lt. Josh Barnhart.",
            "David Hance slept on the porch of his mother’s Foresthill mobile home when he woke up to a glowing red sky early Wednesday morning and was ordered to evacuate.",
            "“It was actually fricking terrifying, cause they say, ‘Oh yeah, it’s coming closer,’” he said. “It was like sunset in the middle of the night.”",
            "Hance left behind most of his electronic gear, all his clothing and family photos and fled to Auburn, where he found his mother, Linda Hance, who said the biggest stress is wondering: “Is my house still there?”",
            "Organizers of the Tour de Tahoe announced Friday they were canceling the annual 72-mile (115-km) bicycle ride scheduled Sunday around Lake Tahoe because of the heavy smoke from the blaze — more than 50 miles (80 km) away — and noted that cycling is a “heavy cardio activity that does not pair well with terrible air quality.” Last year’s ride was canceled due to smoke from another big fire south of Tahoe.",

            "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian forces on Friday claimed new success in their counteroffensive against Russian forces in the country's east, taking control of a sizeable village and pushing toward an important transport junction. The United States' top diplomat and the head of NATO noted the advances, but cautioned that the war is likely to drag on for months.",
            "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy commended the military for its gains in the east, saying in a nightly video address that Ukrainian troops have reclaimed more than 30 settlements in the Kharkiv region since the start of the counteroffensive there this week.",
            "“We are gradually taking control over more settlements, returning the Ukrainian flag and protection for our people.” Zelenskyy said.",
            "Ukraine's military said it also launched new attacks on Russian pontoon bridges used to bring supplies across the Dnieper River to Kherson, one of the largest Russian-occupied cities, and the adjacent region. Ukrainian artillery and rocket strikes have left all regular bridges across the river unusable, the military's southern command said.",
            "Anxiety increased about Europe's largest nuclear power plant, which was operating in emergency mode Friday for the fifth straight day due to the war. That prompted the head of the U.N. atomic watchdog to call for the establishment of an immediate safety zone around the plant to prevent a nuclear accident.",
            "The six-reactor Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant came under the control of Russian forces early in the war but is being operated by Ukrainian staff. The plant and surrounding areas have been repeatedly hit by shelling that Russia and Ukraine blame on each other. The last power line connecting the plant to the Ukrainian electricity grid was cut Monday, leaving the plant without an outside source of electricity. It is receiving power for its own safety systems from the only reactor — out of six total — that remains operational.",
            "In other advances, the Ukrainian military said it took control of the village of Volokhiv Yar in the Kharkiv region and aimed to advance toward strategically valuable town of Kupiansk, which would cut off Russian forces from key supply routes.",
            "Pro-Russian authorities in the Kupiansk district announced that civilians were being evacuated toward the Russian-held region of Luhansk.",
            "“The initial signs are positive and we see Ukraine making real, demonstrable progress in a deliberate way,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in Brussels, a day after visiting Kyiv.",
            "“But this is likely to go on for some significant period of time,” he said. “There are a huge number of Russian forces in Ukraine and unfortunately, tragically, horrifically, President (Vladimir) Putin has demonstrated that he will throw a lot of people into this at huge cost to Russia.”",
            "NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who met with Blinken, said the war is “entering a critical phase.”",
            "The gains \"are modest and only the first successes of the counteroffensive of the Ukrainian army, but they are important both in terms of seizing the military initiative and raising the spirit of Ukrainian soldiers,” Mykola Sunhurovskyi, a military analyst at the Razumkov Center in Kyiv, told The Associated Press.",
            "Energoatom, Ukraine's state nuclear operator, said Friday that repairs to outside electric lines at the Zaporizhzhia plant are impossible because of the shelling and that operating the plant in what is called an “island” status carries \"the risk of violating radiation and fire safety standards.”",
            "\"Only the withdrawal of the Russians from the plant and the creation of a security zone around it can normalize the situation at the Zaporizhzhia NPP. Only then will the world be able to exhale,” Petro Kotin, the head of Energoatom, told Ukrainian TV.",
            "Earlier, Kotin told The Associated Press the plant's only operating reactor “can be stopped completely\" at any moment and as a consequence, the only power source would be a diesel generator.",
            "There are 20 generators on site and enough diesel fuel for 10 days. After that, about 200 tons of diesel fuel would be needed daily for the generators, which he said is “impossible” to get while the plant is occupied by Russian forces.",
            "Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Friday that there was little likelihood of reestablishing reliable offsite power lines to the plant.",
            "“This is an unsustainable situation and is becoming increasingly precarious,” Grossi said, calling for an “immediate cessation of all shelling in the entire area” and the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone.",
            "“This is the only way to ensure that we do not face a nuclear accident,” he said.",
            "Fighting continued Friday elsewhere in Ukraine.",
            "Russian planes bombed the hospital in the town of Velika Pysarivka, on the border with Russia, said Dmytro Zhyvytskyi, governor of the Sumy region. He said the building was destroyed and there were an unknown number of casualties.",
            "In the Donetsk region in the east — one of two that Russia declared to be sovereign states at the outset of the war — eight people were killed in the city of Bakhmut over the past day and the city is without water and electricity for the fourth straight day, said governor Pavlo Kyrylenko.",
            "Four people were killed in shelling in the Kharkiv region, two of them in the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest, according to governor Oleh Syniehubov. The shelling of the city continued Friday afternoon, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said, wounding 10 people, including three children.",
            "Ukraine this week claimed to have regained control of more than 20 settlements in the Kharkiv region, including the small city of Balakliya. Social media posts showed weeping, smiling Balakliya residents embracing Ukrainian soldiers.",

            "CHICAGO (AP) — An ex-business manager for R. Kelly and his co-defendant at the singer’s federal trial in Chicago expressed doubts on the witness stand Thursday about Kelly’s insistence in the 2000s that he never sexually abused minors — testifying a day after the former employee told jurors he had had no reason to doubt his boss was telling the truth.",
            "Derrell McDavid’s testimony, which could be a major blow to Kelly’s hope of acquittal, came at the end McDavid’s second day on the stand. He and the Grammy winner are charged with successfully fixing Kelly’s 2008 child pornography trial by threatening witnesses and concealing video evidence. Both also face child pornography charges.",
            "Asked by his own lawyer, Beau Brindley, if he was in “a different position” now as far as assessing allegations against Kelly after sitting through government testimony by four Kelly accusers, McDavid responded solemnly: “Yes, I am.”",
            "“The last (few) weeks … I’ve learned a lot … that I had no idea about in 2008,” he said. When he added that, “as I stand here today, I’m embarrassed… sad,” Kelly’s lead lawyer, Jennifer Bonjean, objected. Judge Harry Leinenweber sustained her objection.",
            "McDavid, who said earlier he once saw Kelly as a son, was also asked Thursday if he had wanted to believe Kelly in the 2000s and through to the end of Kelly’s 2008 trial.",
            "“I absolutely did,” he answered, “because I loved him and I believed in him.”",
            "It is in McDavid’s interest to say he believed Kelly in much of the 2000s because it undermines the government’s case that McDavid knew Kelly was guilty heading into the 2008 trial and would, if evidence wasn’t suppressed, be convicted.",
            "With jurors out of the courtroom earlier, Bonjean said she was worried McDavid would — as he ended up doing — cast doubt about Kelly’s believability. She said it would unfairly prejudice her client in jurors’ eyes and, on some counts, seal his fate.",
            "Kelly’s defense team has several times asked that Kelly’s trial be severed from McDavid’s and that Kelly be tried alone, saying their interests at a joint trial would inevitably conflict. Leinenweber has repeatedly rejected that request.",
            "Among the charges only Kelly faces at the current trial are five counts of enticing minor girls for sex — one count for five Kelly accusers. McDavid’s testimony toward the end of the day Thursday could potentially lend credence to those accusations.",
            "Prosecutors are set to start what could be a blistering cross-examination of McDavid on Friday. McDavid’s lengthy testimony seemed to open doors for prosecutors to ask him about otherwise barred topics, including evidence entered by state prosecutors at Kelly’s 2008 trial.",
            "Earlier Thursday, McDavid also testified that a push to recover purported Kelly sex videos prior to the 2008 trial was driven, not by himself or Kelly, but by Kelly’s now deceased-criminal lawyer, Ed Genson.",
            "With that testimony, McDavid sought to distance himself from decisions to aggressively pursue videos prior to the 2008 trial, including by offering six-figure payoffs for lost or stolen videos.",
            "The ongoing trial in Kelly’s hometown is, in ways , a do-over of that 2008 trial. A single video, which state prosecutors said showed Kelly sexually abusing a girl of around 14, was at the heart of that trial. The same video is in evidence at the current trial.",
            "The girl in the video, then an adult, did not testify at that 2008 trial, which jurors said at the time was one reason they couldn’t convict Kelly. She did testify at the current trial under the pseudonym, “Jane.”",
            "The otherwise dry, matter-of-fact McDavid sounded emotional for the first time in two days on the stand when asked Thursday how he felt when jurors at the 2008 trial acquitted Kelly on all charges.",
            "“I was happy,” he said, his voice appearing to break.",
            "During one lunch break during McDavid’s testimony, McDavid stood next to Kelly sitting at his defense table — the two chatting amiably.",
            "On Thursday, McDavid told jurors he and Kelly began to grow apart in the years after the 2008 trial, friction between them highlighted by financial disputes. He quit working for Kelly in 2014, he testified.",
            "On Wednesday, McDavid told jurors he had seen Jane when she was a minor hanging around Kelly’s studio in the late 1990s. He said Kelly angrily denied rumors he was sexually abusing Jane, who Kelly described as his god daughter.",
            "“I believed him,” McDavid testified.",
            "Testifying earlier, Jane, now 37, said Kelly sexually abused her hundreds of time starting when she was 14. She also said she was the girl in the video at the center of the 2008 trial and entered as evidence at the current trial. She said Kelly produced it.",
            "McDavid is the only one of the three defendants testifying in his own behalf. Both Kelly and Milton Brown, the third co-defendant, told the trial judge last week they would not testify.",
            "This trial follows a separate federal trial in New York, where the 55-year-old Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in June."

            "The death of Queen Elizabeth II leads every national newspaper in the U.K. on Friday morning.",
            "The queen, who was the U.K.’s longest-serving monarch, is being remembered for her steadfast commitment to her role and her lifetime dedication to the crown.",
            "Here’s a look at those historic front pages.",
            "The Times is one of the outlets which uses a famous photo by Cecil Beaton that marked the monarch’s coronation back in 1953 — aged 27 — to honor her passing, alongside a caption: “A life in service.”",
            "The Daily Star uses the same image, with the headline: ”‘You did your duty, ma’am.’”",
            "The Independent and The Guardian splash with that famous photo too, although neither paper includes a quote, simply the date of the queen’s birth and death — 1926 to 2022.",
            "The i also goes for the same photograph, but has a more informative front page with a breakdown of the four key details from the day. It explains that the monarch died in Balmoral in the afternoon, and that the country is likely to enter 10 days of mourning. The queen’s successor, King Charles III, will be making an address on Friday too.",
            "The Daily Mail opts for an image of the queen from 1952, when she was still Princess Elizabeth, first in line to the throne. She’s pictured without the crown jewels, but with a smaller crown and ornate decorative jewellery. Its front page carries a quote from its columnist Sarah Vine: “Our hearts are broken.”",
            "The Metro’s front page includes another photo from the same occasion, except in this one the queen is slightly smiling while looking over her shoulder. It carries the dates of her life, 1926 to 2022.",
            "The Financial Times used a more candid image than its competitors, opting for a photo of the queen in her finery while leaning out of a carriage, smiling, with her full title in its headline — “Queen Elizabeth II, 1926-2022.”",
            "The Sun uses a more modern, but still formal, portrait of the queen for its front page, displayed in black and white, with a purple masthead, while choosing another image of the late monarch in her youth for its back page. On the front, it goes with the headline: “We loved you Ma’am.”",
            "Below, it has a caption remembering her as Britain’s longest-serving monarch, and concluding: “We are proud you were our Queen.”",
            "The Daily Express uses the same photo of the queen from the modern era, accompanying the caption: “Our beloved Queen is dead.”",
            "The Daily Record chooses an image of the monarch in profile, in her finery during a special occasion, while smiling. It foregoes a headline altogether, just writing: “Queen Elizabeth II: 1926 - 2022.”",
            "The Mirror also uses an image of the queen in profile, but this time she has a more somber expression. This picture is just accompanied by the headline: “Thank you.”",
            "The Daily Telegraph opts for the same black and white image of the queen that the royal family released to announce her death.",
            "The paper attaches a quote from a speech the monarch shared when sending her condolences to the U.S. over 9/11: ”Grief is the price we pay for love.”",
            "Regional newspapers across the country also acknowledged the historic occasion too, although some used less formal images to mark her death.",
            "Scottish newspaper The Herald, however, did choose a formal image showing the queen in her finery while standing in the Highlands.",
            "Away from the British press, newspapers all over the world honored the late monarch.",
            "The New York Times, the New Yorker and TIME magazine all gave their front pages to the queen.",
            "Italian Corriere della Sera honoured the queen too, as did the French newspapers Liberation and Le Temps, alongside German newspaper Bild."

            "ISLAMABAD (AP) — U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Friday that the world owes impoverished Pakistan “massive” help in recovering from devastating floods because other nations have contributed much more to climate change, which experts say may have helped trigger the deluge.",
            "Months of monsoons and flooding have killed 1,391 people and affected 3.3 million in this South Asian nation while half a million people have become homeless. Planeloads of aid from the United States, the United Arab Emirates and other countries have begun arriving, but there’s more to be done, Guterres said.",
            "Nature, the U.N. chief said in Islamabad, has attacked Pakistan, which contributes less than 1% of global emissions, according to multiple experts. Nations that “are more responsible for climate change ... should have faced this challenge,” Guterres said, seated next to Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.",
            "“We are heading into a disaster,” Guterres added. “We have waged war on nature and nature is tracking back and striking back in a devastating way. Today in Pakistan, tomorrow in any of your countries.”",
            "The U.N. chief’s trip comes less than two weeks after Guterres appealed for $160 million in emergency funding to help those affected by the monsoon rains and floods that Pakistan says have caused at least $10 billion in damages. On Friday, the first planeload arrived from the U.S. , which Washington says is part of an upcoming $30 million in assistance.",
            "“I appeal for massive support from the international community as Pakistan responds to this climate catastrophe,” Guterres tweeted after landing in Pakistan earlier Friday.",
            "He said other nations contributing to climate change are obligated to reduce emissions and help Pakistan. He assured Sharif that his voice was “entirely at the service of the Pakistani government and the Pakistani people” and that “the entire U.N. system is at the service of Pakistan.”",
            "“Pakistan has not contributed in a meaningful way to climate change, the level of emissions in this country is relatively low,” Guterres said. “But Pakistan is one of the most dramatically impacted countries by climate change.”",
            "Later, Guterres directed his words to the international community, saying that by some estimates, Pakistan needs about $30 billion to recover.",
            "So far, U.N. agencies and several countries have sent nearly 60 planeloads of aid, and authorities say the UAE has been one of the most generous contributors and sent so far 26 flights carrying aid for flood victims.",
            "Also Friday, Samantha Power, the administrator of USAID, met with Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari in Islamabad.",
            "The floods have touched all of Pakistan, including heritage sites such as Mohenjo Daro, a UNESCO World Heritage Site considered one of the best-preserved ancient urban settlements in South Asia. The civilization that dates back 4,500 years, coinciding with those of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia.",
            "The U.N. heritage agency on Thursday announced it would send $350,000 to help recover flood-damaged cultural heritage sites.",
            "Since June, heavy rains and floods have added new burdens to cash-strapped Pakistan and highlighted the disproportionate effect of climate change on impoverished populations. Experts say Pakistan is responsible for only 0.4% of the world’s historic emissions that are blamed for climate change. The U.S. is responsible for 21.5%, China for 16.5% and the European Union for 15%.",
            "The floods in Pakistan have also injured 12,722 people, destroyed thousands of miles of roads, toppled bridges and damaged schools and hospitals, according to the National Disaster Management Agency."

            "Las Vegas police said Thursday that they have connected the DNA of a county official to the recent murder of investigative journalist Jeff German, whose coverage of alleged misconduct ultimately contributed to the official losing his primary election this summer.",
            "At a news conference, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said that Clark County Public Administrator Robert Telles was arrested at his Las Vegas home and booked Wednesday night on a charge of murder with a deadly weapon. The 45-year-old Democrat was taken out of his home on a stretcher with what police said were self-inflicted wounds that were not life-threatening.",
            "Telles, 45, is accused of stabbing the Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter to death. Police said that they found German’s body on Saturday morning outside of the reporter’s house and that he was likely killed Friday morning.",
            "“This has been an unusual case from the beginning, the murder of an investigative journalist and the main suspect an elected official here in Clark County,” Lombardo said. “This is a terrible and jarring homicide, one that has deeply impacted Las Vegas. Every murder is tragic, but the killing of a journalist is particularly troublesome.”",
            "Dori Koren, captain of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police’s homicide division, said that a man was documented on surveillance images walking toward German’s home on Friday and then to the side of his house. The man was wearing a straw hat, a bright orange long-sleeved shirt and gray sneakers, and was carrying a duffel bag. When German exited his house through the garage door and went to the side of the house, the intruder got into an altercation with him and the journalist was stabbed multiple times.",
            "Police identified a vehicle seen driving around German’s neighborhood on the morning of the murder, prior to the murder and at the time of the murder. Koren also said that the man described by police had fled in that vehicle, a maroon GMC Yukon Denali SUV with chrome handles, a sunroof and a luggage rack.",
            "Telles became a person of interest because of his publicly expressed hatred toward the 69-year-old journalist and because a vehicle matching the description of the killer’s car was parked in front of his home. Video evidence showed the car leaving Telles’ home the morning of the homicide and arriving back shortly after the estimated time of the death. Police say they discovered Telles was driving the car that morning.",
            "When law enforcement searched Telles’ home, vehicles and body, they said they found a pair of shoes matching the killer’s clothing, splattered with blood and cut “likely in a manner to destroy evidence.” Police also said they recovered a straw hat matching the description, cut in a similar manner.",
            "“One of the most important aspects of this investigation was waiting on the DNA results, and we received positive DNA results that showed Robert Telles’ DNA at the crime scene,” Koren said.",
            "Lombardo said that police have not yet recovered a weapon but that the investigation is still active. Telles voluntarily was interviewed by police and chose not to retain a lawyer, according to the Las Vegas Police Department. He is being held at the Clark County Detention Center.",
            "“Jeff was a loving and loyal brother, uncle and friend who devoted his life to his work exposing wrongdoing in Las Vegas and beyond. We’re shocked, saddened and angry about his death,” German’s family said in a statement obtained Thursday by the Review-Journal.",
            "“Jeff was committed to seeking justice for others and would appreciate the hard work by local police and journalists in pursuing his killer. We look forward to seeing justice done in this case,” the statement said. “We also want to thank everyone for the outpouring of love, support and recognition for Jeff and his life’s work.”",
            "German was a tenacious reporter who covered crime, courts, government corruption and mob figures for decades in Las Vegas. The journalist had launched a months-long investigation this year into Telles’ office, which included allegations of abuses and an inappropriate relationship with an employee.",
            "German’s investigation into the potential wrongdoing led to public outrage by Telles, who regularly tweeted his anger at the reporter. After a series of stories on Telles, the official lost his reelection bid in the June primary.",
            "According to police, Telles was likely also upset that German was conducting additional reporting on the official. The journalist recently filed public records requests for emails and texts between Telles and three other county officials ― one of whom was identified in previous stories as the employee Telles allegedly had a relationship with, according to the Review-Journal.",
            "“The death of Jeff German was both shocking and tragic, and we join with our community in being stunned at how this situation has continued to evolve over the last few days,” county spokesperson Stacey Welling said in a statement. “Clark County continues to cooperate with the LVMPD on this active investigation. Our condolences are with Jeff German’s family, friends, and colleagues at the Review-Journal.”",
            "The county said it is “reviewing its options under the law regarding” Telles’ position as the public administrator, which is an elected office. The county has suspended Telles’ access to county offices and property for “the safety of our county employees and the public” and said that employees of the administrator’s office are working remotely while the office remains closed “until a determination is made about when it can open.”",
            "“When county management was made aware of the personnel issues at the public administrator’s office a couple of months ago, the decision was made to no longer have staff in the public administrator’s office report to Mr. Telles and this solution will be in place until the public elects a new Public Administrator in November,” Welling said.",
            "Lombardo said Thursday that it was an “inappropriate venue to speculate or opine on” whether German’s death is part of a nationwide normalization of violence against journalists.",
            "“I think it needs to be stated and noted that it is troublesome because it is a journalist, and we expect journalism to be open and transparent and the watchdog for government,” he said. “And when people take it upon themselves to create harm associated with that profession, I think it’s very important we put all eyes on and address the case appropriately ― such as we did in this case.”"

            "“Michelle Obama is at the White House for her portrait unveiling, and her hair is in box braids,” another Twitter user wrote. “You have no idea what seeing that means for Black women. Little Black girls. I’m emotional.”",

            "“Oh dude, that was horrible,” Reedus told EW. “That whole ordeal for me personally was terrifying. I thought I was going to die.”",
            "Details about how the injury occurred have not been released.",
            "Just like his survivalist “Walking Dead” character Daryl Dixon, Reedus knows how to forge ahead. The actor has endured his fair share of injuries across 11 seasons of the hit AMC show, which will end in November. He once fell off a motorcycle, for instance, and cut his hand on a prop.",
            "On March 11, however, Reedus suffered a concussion so bad he had to be hospitalized for weeks. Details of the incident remained sparse and suggested Reedus was simply taking his time to recover. The actor himself, many of whose scenes were finished by a stand-in, now begs to differ.",
            "“It was very serious,” Reedus told EW. “It was scary. I’ve been hit in the face and the head a million times. I’ve gone through car windows, but that one rung my bell.”",
            "“I had a neurologist. I had all sorts of shit,” Reedus added. “I failed the light test. I had a security guard in the driveway, just in case. I was holding onto the walls walking through the rooms. It was nuts.”",
            "Reedus has indeed gone through a car window before. Struck by an 18-wheeler in 2005 after an R.E.M. concert in Berlin, he required surgery for a new titanium eye socket and four screws in his nose. At the time, Reedus was convinced his career was over.",

            "A proposal to protect abortion rights in Michigan is back on the November ballot, thanks to the state’s Supreme Court.",
            "The proposal would amend Michigan’s Constitution, codifying an array of reproductive rights that are currently in jeopardy thanks to this summer’s U.S. Supreme Court decision overruling Roe v. Wade.",
            "With Roe no longer in force, states have the power to pass new laws prohibiting abortion or to enforce old bans that are still on the books. The latter is an especially real possibility in Michigan, where a 1931 law prohibits abortion at any stage of pregnancy and in almost all circumstances.",
            "The law is not being enforced at the moment, thanks to several lower court rulings that prevent prosecutors from bringing cases. But abortion rights opponents have appealed those decisions.",
            "The goal of the abortion rights amendment is to settle these questions once and for all, so that neither judges nor lawmakers could take away abortion access in Michigan. And that idea appears to have a great deal of support.",
            "A Record Number Of Signatures, Plus A Few Typos",
            "In July, organizers submitted petitions supporting the amendment with more than 750,000 signatures from across the state. That was nearly twice as many as necessary, and consistent with the strong support for abortion rights among Michiganders that recent polling has detected.",
            "But opponents of the measure said those petitions were not valid, because of what was basically a series of typos: Spaces between some of the words were not readily visible, thanks to a glitch in the printing. This made the petitions incomprehensible, opponents claimed, and thus not valid as proof the amendment had enough support to qualify for the ballot.",
            "Last week, that argument prevailed with the two Republicans who sit on Michigan’s four-person election board. The two Republicans voted against authorizing the amendment, producing a deadlock along party lines.",
            "If that had been the final word, the amendment would not be on the November ballot.",
            "But immediately after the elections board voted, the amendment’s supporters asked the state Supreme Court to intervene, arguing that the meaning of the amendment was clear even with the compressed words ― and that the elections board had no authority to block an initiative when it so clearly had enough public support.",
            "On Thursday, the court agreed that the amendment’s meaning was clear, and ordered the election board to certify the amendment. The board next meets on Friday, which is also the deadline for county clerks to finalize November ballot designs.",
            "Sharp Words In Dueling Opinions",
            "The vote on the seven-member court was 5-2, and in a brief, unsigned opinion, the majority explained that “the meaning of the words has not changed by the alleged insufficient spacing between them.”",
            "But several justices chimed in with more thoughts ― including Chief Justice Bridget Mary McCormack, who was part of the majority and wrote a stinging concurring opinion.",
            "“Seven hundred fifty three thousand and seven hundred fifty nine Michiganders signed this proposal ― more than have ever signed any proposal in Michigan’s history,” McCormack wrote.",
            "Noting that the challengers produced no evidence that any voters were actually confused by the wording, McCormack accused those opponents of trying to “disenfranchise millions of Michiganders ... because they think they have identified a technicality that allows them to do so, a game of gotcha gone very bad.”",
            "Justice Brian Zahra, one of the two dissenters, had some pointed words of his own. He protested the decision to issue a ruling without oral argument, then zeroed in on the substantive dispute ― and why, in his opinion, it mattered.",
            "“The only thing more difficult to discern than the disputed portions of the text of the amendment is why the proponents of the amendment proceeded to circulate a petition that plainly did not conform to the form and content of the petition preapproved by the Bureau of Elections,” Zahra wrote.",
            "A Legal Decision With Potentially Big Political Effects",
            "The amendment’s placement on the ballot could have a significant effect on the outcome of other races, by increasing turnout among voters who support abortion rights.",
            "That is likely to help candidates who also support abortion rights ― including incumbent Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) and Attorney General Dana Nessel (D), both of whom are up for reelection and have made abortion a central focus of their campaigns.",
            "It could also help Democrats seeking U.S. House seats, including several in tightly contested races whose outcomes could effectively determine which party controls the chamber starting in January.",
            "The caveat is that the polls could be wrong: The amendment might not be as popular as it seems. Or sentiments could change as opponents hammer away at it.",
            "If that happens, then the amendment could fail and its supporters running for office could lose ― which, in the case of the governor’s race, would mean a victory for Republican Tudor Dixon.",
            "Dixon has said she supports the 1931 ban, including its lack of exceptions for rape and incest. If there’s no new amendment in the state constitution and she’s the one in the governor’s office, then abortion might not be legal in Michigan for much longer."

            "PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — People with disabilities in Portland, Oregon, have sued the city, saying they can’t navigate its sidewalks because of sprawling homeless encampments.",
            "The federal class action lawsuit says the city has violated the Americans with Disabilities Act by allowing homeless people’s tents to block city sidewalks, making it difficult for people using wheelchairs, walkers or canes to use them.",
            "“The entire class of persons with disabilities are regularly deprived of the benefits of services of the city of Portland,” said John DiLorenzo, lead counsel for the plaintiffs.",
            "The suit was filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Portland.",
            "The plaintiffs include nine people with disabilities and a caretaker. Among the plaintiffs is Keith Martin, a 71-year-old a Portland resident who has used a wheelchair since having a stroke three years ago.",
            "“I couldn’t get to my breakfast in the morning because there was a tent covering the whole sidewalk,” Martin said. “I was forced onto the street and narrowly missed a streetcar that came around the corner.”",
            "Oregon’s homelessness crisis has been fueled by a housing shortage, the coronavirus pandemic and high drug addiction rates. Federal data from the latest National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that 9% of teens and adults in Oregon had illicit drug use disorders in 2020. That year, the state also ranked last in access to drug addiction treatment, according to the survey.",
            "The class action suit seeks to require the city to clear all sidewalks of tent encampments and debris, and to “construct, purchase, or otherwise provide for emergency shelters in which to house the unsheltered persons” who may be affected.",
            "Such measures would make sidewalks accessible for people with disabilities in a safe manner while providing a safe place for unhoused people, DiLorenzo said.",
            "Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler’s office said the mayor is meeting with the city attorney before providing comment.",
            "About 13% of Portlanders live with a disability, according to the lawsuit, including 6% with mobility impairments and 2.4% with visual impairments.",
            "Plaintiff Steve Jackson, 47, is legally blind and uses a cane to walk. He said tents prevent him from navigating the sidewalk and accessing bus stops.",
            "“Often there’s tents blocking the entire sidewalk, where I don’t see them because they weren’t there the day before, and I hit the tent and then people are mad at me and think I’m attacking them,” Jackson said during a news conference.",
            "There were about 3,000 unsheltered people living in Multnomah County, home to Portland, during the most recent point-in-time count in January 2022, county figures show.",
            "The Portland City Council declared a state of emergency on homelessness in 2015 and has extended it five times since then. The measure, now set to expire in 2025, reduces the bureaucratic hurdles surrounding the creation of homeless shelters.",
            "Despite the city’s years-long emergency measure, the estimated number of people experiencing homelessness spiked 25% in the Portland area between 2020 and 2022, according to point-in-time counts reported to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.",
            "This year alone, Wheeler has issued four emergency declarations to address homelessness issues. Most recently in August, he expanded a previous declaration that prohibits camping along high-speed corridors such as highways to include key walking routes to K-12 schools.",
            "The state has wrestled with a debate over the best way to reduce homelessness. Some business groups have called for more encampment sweeps and stricter enforcement of anti-camping ordinances, while others want more investment in social services and affordable housing.",
            "Oregon lawmakers earlier this year approved a budget that includes $400 million to address homelessness and housing.",

            "The fire that began late Tuesday trapped workers and customers inside the multi-story venue in Thuan An city in Binh Duong province, state media said. The fire was brought under control quickly but smoldered into the next day.",
            "Vietnam News Agency reported 32 deaths from the blaze as of late Wednesday and at least one karaoke room and one storage room have not been accessed because the temperature remained high.",
            "Some people were injured from asphyxiation and others suffered broken limbs when they jumped from upper floors to try to escape the fire, reports said. Firefighters using ladders from their trucks managed to rescue others.",
            "President Nguyen Xuan Phuc extended his condolences to families of the victims and asked government officials to support the families and quickly find the cause of the blaze. The preliminary finding was that it was caused by an electrical short circuit and started on the second or third floor.",

            "The Major League Baseball Players Association plans to join the AFL-CIO labor federation, putting one of professional sports’ top unions in a formal alliance with other labor groups.",
            "Tony Clark, the former switch-hitting first baseman who is now the union’s director, announced the new affiliation at the National Press Club in downtown Washington on Wednesday. He was joined by Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO, which includes 57 other unions representing more than 12 million workers.",
            "Clark said the pandemic-shortened 2020 season and the lockout that preceded the current season prompted the union to think about its own place in the labor movement.",
            "“The truth is we reflected on where our organization was and the things we could potentially do moving forward as part of the broader labor discussion,” Clark said.",
            "The AFL-CIO functions as a powerful lobby for organized labor in Washington, looking out for the interests of its member unions legislatively, and acts as a bridge between unions operating in different industries. The federation was formed in 1955 in a marriage between the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations.",
            "The MLBPA represents around 1,200 baseball players, many of whom make a lot of money. By joining the AFL-CIO, the union will be affiliated with many working-class unions, including Unite Here, which represents thousands of concessions workers at baseball stadiums around the country.",
            "The AFL-CIO also includes the NFL Players Association and the National Women’s Soccer League Players Association. The National Basketball Players Association is not a member.",
            "The baseball players union joins the federation at a time when it’s trying to organize more workers. The MLBPA announced Tuesday that it had gathered union authorization cards from more than half of minor league players. That would be more than enough cards to trigger a union election under the National Labor Relations Board, but the union has asked Major League Baseball to voluntarily recognize the minor league union.",
            "Clark said the MLBPA hoped to “strengthen our player fraternity” by organizing minor leaguers and improving their working conditions, noting that many struggle to scrape by on extremely low wages.",
            "“The minor league players are the backbone of our industry,” Clark said. “It’s important that they have a voice at the table.”",
            "The potential bargaining unit in the minor leagues would include more than 5,000 players, a large organizing effort for the MLBPA. There may be ways the AFL-CIO could assist in that effort and help amplify the union’s message.",
            "Shuler called the minor league campaign “an inspiration.”",
            "“People often think that being a professional athlete means you’re just set up for life,” she said. “I think there are a lot of misperceptions out there about that. Minor league players are dealing with poverty wages ... and a chronic lack of respect.”",
            "Unions typically pay per-capita taxes to be members of the AFL-CIO, meaning workers indirectly fund their union’s membership. Clark did not get into the specifics of the MLBPA’s arrangement with the AFL-CIO, but said players recognized that “now was the time” to join.",
            "George Atallah, a spokesperson for the NFL players union, said it was important for all of the sports unions to be “aligned” with one another as well as the other unions on the periphery of their industries. Being part of the AFL-CIO can help accomplish that, he said.",
            "“When we were locked out in 2011, the first people who came to our aid were the steelworkers, the hotel workers, the communications workers. They were all there for us,” Atallah said. “Solidarity is not just one union within itself but from one union to another.”",
            "The Major League Baseball owners locked out the players ahead of the 2022 season for three months before both sides reached a new 5-year collective bargaining agreement.",
            "Matthew Loeb, president of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, said Wednesday that the work stoppage showed how much “common interest” players have with other workers, noting that many of his union’s members in broadcasting weren’t able to work until the lockout was resolved.",
            "Shuler said there was “no question” that major league ballplayers have a large platform, and that their star power could help the AFL-CIO and its member unions in their battles with employers. But she said that wasn’t the significance of the MLBPA joining.",
            "“The point here is we’re all workers, and we all have the same struggles,” Shuler said. “Whether you’re working on the pitch or on a baseball field or on a construction site, we’re all concerned about safe workplaces.”"

            "Despite making up 25% of the global population, Muslims only account for 1% of characters on popular television shows, according to a report released Wednesday.",
            "The findings, which come from an analysis of 200 top-rated television shows aired in the U.S., U.K., Australia and New Zealand between 2018 and 2019, indicate yet again that the global entertainment industry has either sidelined Muslim voices entirely or cast Muslim actors in roles rooted in stereotypes.",
            "“What we’re seeing is content creators and casting directors that have no imagination,” said Stacy Smith, the founder of the University of Southern California’s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative and the lead author of the study.",
            "“This is people being lazy with a group of people that routinely are being dehumanized as either perpetrators or victims of violence, or with disparaging comments.”",
            "Such storylines can contribute to a host of concerns in the real world, including aggression toward and fear of Muslims, Smith said.",
            "The report, titled “Erased or Extremists: The Stereotypical View of Muslims in Popular Episodic Series,” was released with support from the USC initiative, Pillars Fund and the Ford Foundation, as well as actor Riz Ahmed and his production company, Left Handed Films.",
            "Among the shows review as part of the study, 87% did not feature a single Muslim character. The 200 scripted series included just 98 Muslim characters out of 8,885 speaking roles — a ratio of about 1-to-90.",
            "When Muslim characters did make an appearance on screen, they were largely portrayed as violent or foreign, and referred to with words like “terrorist,” “predator” and “monster.” Thirty percent of the Muslim characters in the sample perpetrated violent acts against another character, and nearly 40% were targets of violence.",
            "Despite the fact that Muslims are the most racially and ethnically diverse religious group in the world, the majority of speaking Muslim characters were depicted as Middle Eastern or North African. Only 13% of all Muslim characters were shown as native to countries that are not majority Muslim. Meanwhile, two were depicted as immigrants.",
            "Of all the speaking Muslim characters in the scripted series, about 70% were male and 30% were female. Muslim girls and women on screen typically faced some sort of distress, including emotional duress or physical danger.",
            "“We didn’t see them really leading their own storylines or showing them in empowering roles — which, again, creates this light that Muslim women cannot be leaders and they cannot be empowered,” said Al-Baab Khan, one of the authors of the study.",
            "She said such depictions are harmful because they reinforce the image of Muslim women “as being oppressed, as being fearful or as being less-than, which is not true.”",
            "A separate study released by the same researchers last year found that fewer than 2% of movie characters with speaking roles were Muslim.",
            "“We see that even across all media content in film and TV ... Muslims are extremely erased on screen. And that poses a huge issue because when we think about Muslims in the real world, we make up a quarter of the world’s population,” Khan said.",
            "“It’s really hard to even justify such a disproportionate representation on screen. And it’s really sad because growing up in America, you want to be able to see your own community.”",
            "The issue isn’t unique to Muslims. Hollywood has long faced criticism for its abysmal track record on diversity and the lack of Black, Asian, Hispanic and Latino actors in lead roles.",
            "Pillars, which issues financial grants to Muslim groups, put up a billboard in Los Angeles ahead of next week’s Primetime Emmy Awards to highlight data from the new report and start an overdue conversation about the lack of Muslim representation in the industry.",
            "“We wanted to use Emmy Award season to have folks consider something else, which is that the quantity and quality of characters on screen has a huge impact on the daily lived experiences of Muslims around the globe,” said Arij Mikati, the managing director of culture change at Pillars.",
            "But for decades, she said, television has not included the “beauty, joy, diversity, and richness of our communities and Muslim communities.”",
            "“Representation for representation’s sake is certainly not our goal. The quality and content of characters on screen have a really massive impact on how people all around the world feel about Muslims and also how Muslims feel about themselves,” she added.",
            "“Film can act as a way for audiences to identify with Muslims, and I really believe it’s an opportunity to create greater empathy for and less prejudice towards Muslims off-screen.”",
            "Shows depicting Muslim lead characters with nuance are slowly becoming more common.",
            "“Ms. Marvel,” which features the first Muslim superhero in Marvel Studios’ “cinematic universe,” debuted on Disney+ earlier this year and quickly became one of the production company’s highest-rated projects.",
            "Meanwhile, Netflix’s “Mo” — based on the life of Muslim comedian Mo Amer — documents the story of a Palestinian refugee in Houston. And last year, the British sitcom “We Are Lady Parts,” which follows a punk band made up of Muslim women, premiered on Peacock.",
            "“We know that people are hungry for those stories. They are unique and relatable, and we’re really excited to invite other Americans to learn more about our vibrant communities,” Mikati said. “This is an opportunity for the industry to see the talent that has long existed in abundance.”"

            "No one knows exactly when the next recession will happen, but layoff victims will certainly fall into a safety net that is weaker than ever.",
            "After Congress turbocharged jobless benefits in response to the coronavirus pandemic, lawmakers in three states have already slashed the state-funded benefits that are the foundation of the unemployment insurance system.",
            "Lawmakers at the federal level, meanwhile, have lost all appetite for improving the system even after the pandemic exposed its flaws on a national scale. And it’s hard to imagine Congress stepping in with another temporary expansion of benefits as Republicans continue to blame high inflation on the extra benefits Democrats approved last year.",
            "“We’ve seen incredible gridlock in Congress to pass things that are overwhelmingly popular with the public, like the $15 minimum wage,” Rebecca Dixon, director of the National Employment Law Project, told HuffPost. “I think we could get to a place where there is a crisis and Congress can’t get out of gridlock and address it.”",
            "In response to every recession since the 1950s, Congress has added additional weeks of benefits to the standard 26 provided by states. After lawmakers temporarily added 73 weeks of benefits in the wake of the Great Recession, Republicans in 10 states permanently cut the duration of their underlying state programs.",
            "The give-and-take pattern ramped up with the coronavirus pandemic. Congress added weeks of benefits in 2020 and also took the unprecedented steps of temporarily boosting the weekly value of benefits by $600 and expanding eligibility to include workers without traditional payroll jobs, such as rideshare drivers.",
            "Republican governors in 25 states then took the unprecedented step of rejecting extra federal benefits in 2021. State legislatures in 10 states also took up bills cutting benefits, according to Andrew Stettner, director of workforce policy at The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank.",
            "“There was some bad activity last session and we expect some of these states will come back for more,” Stettner said in an email.",
            "Only Iowa, Kentucky and Oklahoma permanently cut benefits in the last legislative session. Kentucky’s new law also imposed stricter work search requirements; Iowa’s requires unemployment recipients to accept jobs at lower wages.",
            "Iowa Republican state representative Michael Bousselot said the safety net should be less of a safety net and more of a trampoline that bounces layoff victims back into jobs.",
            "“What we are proposing to do is to refocus unemployment on ‘re-employment,’ rather than just being a safety net,” Bousselot said in March.",
            "Republicans at the state and federal levels blamed extra benefits for causing a “worker shortage” in 2021, but businesses have continued to complain of worker shortages long after the supplemental benefits disappeared.",
            "One of the most important changes Congress made in 2020 allowed the self-employed and independent contractors, such as Uber drivers, to apply for benefits for the first time in the history of the state-federal unemployment insurance system. The Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program paid workers who were ineligible for regular unemployment because they didn’t have a history of payroll earnings on file with their state government.",
            "A Bloomberg investigation showed that in the first year of the pandemic, Black workers in Georgia were more likely than their white counterparts to be denied regular benefits; the special pandemic benefits helped close some of the gap in benefits coverage. But the program might be better known for fraud than for reducing racial disparities.",
            "Progressive Democrats want to reform the unemployment system so that it covers nontraditional workers, reduces variation among states and stops states from slashing benefits. And they want to upgrade out-of-date information technology used by many state workforce agencies. Some workers had to wait several months for benefits due to the strain an unprecedented surge in claims put on antiquated state systems.",
            "But Democrats omitted the proposals even from the most expansive version of the domestic policy bill they wound up whittling down and passing last month as the Inflation Reduction Act. There’s no hope of its return in the immediate future.",
            "Dixon said it would likely take another crisis to create a window of opportunity for Congress. “It’s so hard to bring attention to this program when there’s not a crisis,” she said.",
            "Many economists expect a recession and widespread job losses sometime in the next year as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates in order to tame inflation by slowing the overall economy. Job growth has remained strong, but there are potential warning signs.",
            "Matt Darling, an employment policy fellow at the Niskanen Center, a center-right think tank, has pointed to widening gaps between the unemployment rates for college-educated workers and those with no higher education, as well as between white workers and Black workers.",
            "“If we are seeing the effects of the Federal Reserve’s [rate hikes], these are the places we’d expect to see them first,” Darling said in an interview.",
            "It’s possible that the widening gaps represent “noise” in the data, but it could be that layoffs have begun to increase for the more vulnerable members of the American workforce.",
            "Dixon said she didn’t think a recession caused by interest rate hikes would be as bad as the one caused by the pandemic or the one caused by the financial crisis more than a decade earlier. But she does expect a familiar pattern in who gets hurt the most.",
            "“I don’t know that there’ll necessarily be widespread pain from the recession, if we have one in the near term, but there will be pain,” she said. “And the people who experience the most pain are also the ones who are most likely to be locked out of the UI system.”"

            "The city of Nikopol, located on the opposite bank of the Dnieper River from Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, was fired on with rockets and heavy artillery, regional governor Valentyn Reznichenko said.",
            "The reports of nearby shelling, which couldn’t be independently verified, have caused international alarm. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, warned the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday that “something very, very catastrophic could take place” at Zaporizhzhia.",
            "“There are fires, blackouts and other things at the (plant) that force us to prepare the local population for the consequences of the nuclear danger,” Reznichenko said.",
            "The potential peril led the U.N. atomic watchdog agency to urge Russia and Ukraine to establish a “nuclear safety and security protection zone” around the plant.",
            "There are fears the fighting could trigger a catastrophe on the scale of the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. The plant was built during the Soviet era and is one of the 10 biggest in the world.",
            "Neither Moscow nor Kiev officials would immediately commit to the idea of a safety zone, saying more details of the proposal were needed.",

            "The Russian military held large-scale military drills that began last week and ended Wednesday in the country’s east that involved forces from China.

            "LOS ANGELES (AP) — A ransomware attack targeting the huge Los Angeles school district prompted an unprecedented shutdown of its computer systems as schools increasingly find themselves vulnerable to cyber breaches at the start of a new year.",
            "The attack on the Los Angeles Unified School District sounded alarms across the country, from urgent talks with the White House and the National Security Council after the first signs of ransomware were discovered late Saturday night to mandated password changes for 540,000 students and 70,000 district employees.",
            "Though the attack used technology that encrypts data and won’t unlock it unless a ransom is paid, in this case the district’s superintendent said no immediate demand for money was made and schools in the nation’s second-largest district opened as scheduled on Tuesday.",
            "Such attacks have become a growing threat to U.S. schools, with several high-profile incidents reported since last year as pandemic-forced reliance on technology increases the impact. And ransomware gangs have in the past planned major attacks on U.S. holiday weekends, when they know IT staffing will be thin and security experts relaxing.",
            "While it was not immediately clear when the LA attack began — officials have only said when it was detected and a district spokesperson declined to answer additional questions — Saturday night’s discovery reached the highest levels of the federal government’s cybersecurity agencies.",
            "According to a senior administration official, this pattern of support was consistent with the Biden administration’s efforts to provide maximum assistance to critical industries affected by such breaches.",
            "The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the federal response, said the school district did not pay ransom, but would not get into detail on what potentially might have been stolen or damaged and what systems were affected by the breach.",
            "The White House’s response to the LA incursion reflects a growing national security concern: A Pew Research Center survey, published last month, found that 71% of Americans say cyberattacks from other countries are a major threat to the U.S.",
            "Authorities believe the LA attack originated internationally and have identified three potential countries where it may have come from, though LA Superintendent Alberto Carvalho would not say which countries may be involved. Most ransomware criminals are Russian speakers who operate without interference from the Kremlin.",
            "LA officials did not identify the ransomware used.",
            "“This was an act of cowardice,” said Nick Melvoin, the school board vice president. “A criminal act against kids, against their teachers and against an education system.”",
            "So far this year, 26 U.S. school districts — including Los Angeles — and 24 colleges and universities have been hit by so-called ransomware, according to Brett Callow, a ransomware analyst at the cybersecurity firm Emsisoft.",
            "With victims increasingly refusing to pay to have their data unlocked, many cybercriminals instead use the same technology to steal sensitive information and demand extortion payments. If the victim doesn’t pay, the data gets dumped online.",
            "Callow said at least 31 of the schools hit this year had data stolen and released online, and noted that eight of the school districts have been hit since Aug. 1. The upsurge on schools as summer vacations end is almost certainly not coincidental, he said.",
            "“It is the No. 1 threat to our safety,” said Michel Moore, chief of the Los Angeles Police Department. “It is an invisible foe and it is tireless.”",
            "Tireless — and expensive, even outside of any monetary demands. A ransomware extortion attack in Albuquerque’s biggest school district forced schools to close for two days in January, while Baltimore City’s response to a 2019 hit on its computer servers cost upwards of $18 million.",
            "The LA attack was discovered around 10:30 p.m. Saturday when staff first detected “unusual activity,” Carvalho said. The perpetrators appear to have targeted the facilities systems, which involves information about private-sector contractor payments — which are publicly available through records requests — rather than confidential details like payroll, health and other data.",
            "He said district IT officials detected the malware and stopped it from propagating but not until after it infected key network systems, necessitating the reset of passwords for all staff and students.",
            "Authorities scrambled to trace the intruders and restrict potential damage.",
            "“We basically shut down every one of our systems,” Carvalho said, noting that each one had been checked and all but one — the facilities system — restarted by late Monday night, when the district first notified the public of the hit.",
            "On Tuesday, federal authorities separately warned of potential ransomware attacks by the criminal syndicate known as Vice Society, which has allegedly disproportionately targeted the education sector.",
            "Authorities have not said whether they believe Vice Society is involved in the LA attack and the group did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.",
            "“The fact that a joint cybersecurity advisory relating to Vice Society was issued within days of the attack on LAUSD being discovered may be telling, especially as this gang has frequently targeted the education sector in both the U.S. and the U.K.,” said Callow, the ransomware expert.",
            "Vice Society first appeared in May 2021 and, rather than a unique variant, it has used ransomware widely available in the Russian-speaking underground, security researchers say. Among victims claimed by Vice Society are the Elmbrook School district in Wisconsin and the Savannah College of Art and Design.",
            "Ransomware gangs routinely dissolve after high-profile attacks such as last year’s Colonial Pipeline incident, which triggered runs on gas stations. Their members then reconstitute under new names.",
            "While there was pressure to cancel school in Los Angeles on Tuesday, officials ultimately decided to stay open.",
            "Had the activity not been discovered on Saturday night, Carvalho said there could have been “catastrophic” consequences.",
            "“If we had lost the ability to run our school buses, over 40,000 of our students would not have been able to get to school, or it would have been a highly disrupted system,” he said.",
            "The district plans to do a forensic audit of the attack to see what can be done to prevent future incursions.",
            "“Every teacher, every employee, every student can be a weak point,” said Soheil Katal, the district’s chief information officer.",

            "The Detroit Tigers’ rookie utility player — and son of seven-time Cy Young Award winner Roger Clemens — caught Shohei Ohtani looking late in Monday night’s 10-0 loss to the Los Angeles Angels.",
            "Mopping up in the eighth inning, Clemens froze last year’s AL MVP with a 68 mph pitch on the outside corner for his first major league strikeout and gave an exuberant strike three call on the mound.",
            "Ohtani hit two home runs earlier — his sixth multi-homer game of the season.",
            "“I’m just trying to get outs, and for it to come like that is obviously super cool,” Clemens said. “He’s the best player in baseball. So it’s a pretty cool moment for me.”",
            "Grinning ear to ear, the 26-year-old Clemens tossed the souvenir ball into the dugout for safe keeping and is hoping to get it signed by the Angels’ two-way star during the final two days of the series.",
            "“It was a wonderful pitch,” Ohtani said through his interpreter.",
            "By far the hardest one of their encounter, too.",
            "Ohtani fouled off a 54 mph delivery from Clemens, took a 57 mph pitch for a ball and then fouled off a 56 mph offering.",
            "“I mean, obviously can’t do it slow enough for Ohtani. Maybe you can throw it slow and slow and slow and then maybe surprise him with a fastball,” Detroit manager A.J. Hinch said. “Big smile on Kody’s face, and Shohei tipped his cap.”",
            "Those were four of the seven slowest pitches Ohtani has faced this season, according to MLB Statcast. The other three were by Tampa Bay outfielder Brett Phillips, including a 53 mph “fastball” during the Angels’ 12-0 victory on May 12, when Reid Detmers threw a no-hitter for Los Angeles.",
            "Clemens was pitching for the third time in the past seven days to save Detroit’s bullpen with the game out of reach. He worked one inning and allowed one run on three hits.",
            "He has pitched six times this season and given up three runs on 10 hits in six innings.",
            "Roger Clemens had 4,672 strikeouts during his 24-year career, third on the all-time list behind Nolan Ryan and Randy Johnson. The Rocket’s first one came against Cleveland’s Mike Hargrove on May 15, 1984.",
            "“I don’t know how (Kody’s) father would have done against (Ohtani), but he can always say he punched him out,” Hinch said."

            "“I am very happy to report that we have returned water pressure to the city,” Reeves said in a statement. “The tanks are full or filling. There are currently zero water tanks at low levels.”",

We’re talking about a set of accumulated challenges that have taken place over the better part of 30 years.”",

The privacy law was implemented in 2018 and gives special protection to children’s data linked to social media accounts, video games and other internet sites.",
            "The New York Times added the Irish regulator first opened an investigation in 2020 amid reports Instagram made the accounts of users aged 13 and 17 public by default, as well as allowing teens with business accounts on the app to publicize their email addresses and phone numbers.

            "AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — A new and worrisome school year begins Tuesday in Uvalde.",
            "There is new high fencing around the Texas community’s public school campuses that still isn’t finished, a heavy police patrol that many families don’t trust and no classes ever again at Robb Elementary School, three months after a gunman with an AR-15-style rifle killed 19 children and two teachers inside two adjoining fourth-grade classrooms.",
            "Ashley Morales is putting her son, Jeremiah, back in class — because she says she has no other choice as a working single mother. She will drop him off outside Uvalde Elementary on the first day. She says parents won’t be allowed inside.",
            "“I’m just nervous, scared,” said Morales, whose son was a third-grader last year at Robb Elementary and lost three friends in the May 24 massacre. During a recent “Meet the Teacher” night, she felt a rush of anxiety walking down the school hall.",
            "“Oh my gosh, it’s actually going to happen,” she said. “School is going to start.”",
            "Although school already started weeks ago in many parts of Texas, officials pushed back the first day of class in Uvalde after a summer of unfathomable heartache, anger and revelations of widespread failures by law enforcement who allowed an 18-year-old gunman to fire inside the adjoining classrooms for more than 70 minutes.",
            "Despite pushing back the start of the year, Uvalde school officials said several enhanced security measures remain incomplete, including installing additional cameras and new locks.",
            "The Texas Department of Public Safety has committed to putting nearly three dozen state troopers on Uvalde campuses — but that is of no comfort to some families since there were more than 90 state troopers on scene during the attack.",
            "More than 100 families in Uvalde signed up for virtual school, while others pulled their kids out of the district and enrolled them in private schools. One teacher who was shot in the abdomen and survived, Elsa Avila, will not be greetings students for the first time in 30 years because she is still recovering.",
            "A damning report by a Texas House committee found that nearly 400 officers in all rushed to Robb Elementary after the shooting but hesitated for more than hour to confront the shooter. Body camera and surveillance footage showed heavily armed officers, some holding bulletproof shields, stacked in the hallway but not advancing to the classroom.",
            "Steve McCraw, head of the Texas Department of Public Safety, called the response “an abject failure.”",
            "Last month, the Uvalde school board fired district police Chief Pete Arredondo, who McCraw and the House report accused of failing to take control of the scene and wasting time by looking for a key for a classroom door that was likely unlocked. The firing has not quieted demands for others to face punishment. One other officer — Uvalde Lt. Mariano Pargas, the acting police chief that day — has been placed on administrative leave."

            "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Russian Ministry of Defense is in the process of purchasing millions of rockets and artillery shells from North Korea for its ongoing fight in Ukraine, according to a newly downgraded U.S. intelligence finding.",
            "A U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the intelligence determination, said Monday that the fact Russia is turning to the isolated state of North Korea demonstrates that “the Russian military continues to suffer from severe supply shortages in Ukraine, due in part to export controls and sanctions.”",
            "U.S. intelligence officials believe that the Russians could look to purchase additional North Korean military equipment in the future. The intelligence finding was first reported by The New York Times.",
            "The U.S. official did not detail how much weaponry Russia intends to purchase from North Korea.",
            "The finding comes after the Biden administration recently confirmed that the Russian military in August took delivery of Iranian-manufactured drones for use on the battlefield in Ukraine.",
            "The White House said last week that Russia has faced technical problems with Iranian-made drones acquired from Tehran in August for use in its war with Ukraine.",
            "Russia picked up Mohajer-6 and Shahed-series unmanned aerial vehicles over several days last month as part what the Biden administration says is likely part of a Russian plan to acquire hundreds of Iranian UAVs for use in Ukraine.",
            "North Korea has sought to tighten relations with Russia as much of Europe and the West has pulled away, blaming the United States for the Ukraine crisis and decrying the West’s “hegemonic policy” as justifying military action by Russia in Ukraine to protect itself.",
            "The North Koreans have hinted interest in sending construction workers to help rebuild Russian-occupied territories in the country’s east.",
            "North Korea’s ambassador to Moscow recently met with envoys from two Russia-backed separatist territories in the Donbas region of Ukraine and expressed optimism about cooperation in the “field of labor migration,” citing his country’s easing pandemic border controls.",
            "In July, North Korea became the only nation aside from Russia and Syria to recognize the independence of the territories, Donetsk and Luhansk, further aligning with Russia over the conflict in Ukraine.",
            "The North’s arms export to Russia would be a violation of U.N. resolutions that ban the country from exporting to or importing weapons from other countries. Its possible dispatch of laborers to the Russian-held territories in Ukraine would also breach a U.N. resolution that required all member states to repatriate all North Korean workers from their soil by 2019.",
            "There have been suspicions that China and Russia haven’t fully enforced U.N. sanctions on North Korea, complicating a U.S.-led attempt to deprive North Korea of its nuclear weapons.",
            "The provocative move by North Korea comes as the Biden administration has become increasingly concerned about stepped-up activity by North Korea in pursuit of nuclear weapons.",
            "North Korea has test-fired more than 30 ballistic missiles this year, including its first flights of intercontinental ballistic missiles since 2017, as leader Kim Jong Un pushes to advance his nuclear arsenal despite U.S.-led pressure and sanctions.",
            "The U.S. has frequently downgraded and unveiled intelligence findings over the course of the grinding war in Ukraine to highlight plans for Russian misinformation operations or to throw attention on Moscow’s difficulties in prosecuting the war. Ukraine’s smaller military has put up a stiff resistance against the militarily superior Russian forces.",
            "Russian President Vladimir Putin and Kim have recently exchanged letters in which they both called for “comprehensive” and “strategic and tactical” cooperation between the countries. Moscow, for its part, has issued statements condemning the revival of large-scale military exercises between the United States and South Korea this year, which North Korea views as an invasion rehearsal.",
            "Russia, along with China, has called for the easing of U.N. sanctions imposed on North Korea over its nuclear and missile tests. Both countries are members of the U.N. Security Council, which has approved a total of 11 rounds of sanctions on the North since 2006. In May, Russia and China vetoed a U.S.-led bid to impose new economic sanctions on North Korea over its high-profile missile tests this year.",
            "Some experts say that Kim could likely bolster his resolve to retain his nuclear weapons because he may think the Russian attack happened because Ukraine had signed away its nuclear arsenal.",
            "Relations between Moscow and Pyongyang go back to the 1948 foundation of North Korea, as Soviet officials installed young, ambitious nationalist Kim Il Sung, the late grandfather of Kim Jong Un, as the country’s first ruler. Since then, Soviet aid shipment had been crucial in keeping North Korea’s economy afloat for decades before the disintegration of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s.",
            "Moscow had since established formal diplomatic relations with Seoul as part of its hopes to draw South Korean investment and allowed its Soviet-era military alliance with North Korea to expire. But after his election in 2000, Putin actively sought to restore his country’s ties with North Korea in what was seen as an effort to regain its traditional domains of influence and secure more allies to better deal with the United States.",

            "VENICE, Italy (AP) — Harry Styles already has an enviable acting resume for a newcomer, from Christopher Nolan’s “Dunkirk” to the upcoming “Don’t Worry Darling” and “My Policeman.” But the pop star said Monday at the Venice International Film Festival that, with acting, he often feels as if he has “no idea what I’m doing.”",
            "Styles’ arrival on the Lido, where “Don’t Worry Darling” is having its world premiere Monday night, has been one of the most anticipated events of a festival full of stars. At a press conference before the premiere, Styles was peppered with questions about his fans, his career and whether or not he would work with director Olivia Wilde again — neither of which he answered.",
            "In “Don’t Worry Darling,” Styles plays Jack, who works for the mysterious Victory Project, run by Chris Pine’s charismatic cult-like leader, in a mid-century-styled experimental community. Florence Pugh plays Jack’s wife Alice, who gets every comfort in the world in exchange for not asking questions. But soon, she starts to see cracks in the veneer.",
            "“I think it’s fun to get to play in worlds that aren’t necessarily your own. This world that is supposedly so perfect, it’s really fun to play pretend in there,” Styles said. “There wasn’t too much acting.”",
            "Styles took several days off from his Madison Square Garden appearances to attend the “Don’t Worry Darling” premiere in Venice, with Wilde and co-stars Pine and Gemma Chan. But though he juggles two high-profile careers in the arts, he said he doesn’t see many parallels between music and acting.",
            "“Personally I find them to be kind of opposite in a lot of ways. I think making music is a really personal thing,” Styles said. “There’s aspects of acting where you’re drawing from experiences you’ve had but for the most part you’re pretending to play someone else. I think that’s what I find the most fun about it: playing pretend.”",

            "Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson (D) said Sunday she and other election officials around the nation are concerned about “violence and disruption” as November’s midterm elections approach.",

            "“Which of course fuels the potential for additional threats, harassment and even violence on Election Day,” she added.",
            "Her comments come amid heated dialogue from both parties. President Joe Biden has been touring the nation, decrying extreme factions of the GOP that have embraced Donald Trump’s “MAGA” ideology. Trump and his surrogates have in turn excoriated Biden as “hateful and divisive.”",
            "Benson said Sunday election officials on both sides of the political spectrum were working “day and night” with law enforcement and other partners to “protect the sanctity of the polling place and protect the integrity of our democracy” heading into November.",
            "“It’s also important to note that we’ve been doing this work now for close to two years, or over two years, and we’ve been succeeding really at every turn. Democracy prevailed in 2020,” she said. “So, we are in many ways even more prepared this year than ever before, than ― even than we were in 2020, to ensure that we are eliminating, mitigating or certainly protecting the system against any potential disruptions.”",
            "Garrett went on to ask if voters should remain curious about election integrity going into the midterms. Benson agreed, saying officials welcomed “questions based on evidence” but said voters should reject efforts to create political instability through disinformation and fear mongering.",
            "“What’s really happened over the last few years is this growth of factless misinformation or allegations based not on evidence, but on aspersions, and really geared towards furthering partisan agendas, and delegitimizing democracy itself,” she said."

            "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Citing an “immediate threat to human life,” Cloudflare has dropped the notorious stalking and harassment site Kiwi Farms from its internet security services following an online campaign started by transgender Twitch streamer Clara Sorrenti to pressure it to do so.",
            "“This is an extraordinary decision for us to make and given Cloudflare’s role as an Internet infrastructure provider, a dangerous one that we are not comfortable with,” CEO Matthew Prince wrote in a blog post Saturday in an about-face after earlier insisting that the company would not block the site. “However, the rhetoric on the Kiwifarms site and specific, targeted threats have escalated over the last 48 hours to the point that we believe there is an unprecedented emergency and immediate threat to human life unlike what we have previously seen from Kiwifarms or any other customer before.”",
            "For years, members of the site created and operated by Joshua Conner Moon, 29, have congregated on what they call a “lighthearted discussion forum” to organize vicious harassment campaigns against transgender people, feminists and others they deem mockable. They gang up on victims and pool their personal details such as addresses and phone numbers in a practice called “doxxing,” spreading vile rumors and targeting workplaces, friends, families and homes. Another favorite tactic has been “swatting” — making false emergency calls to provoke an armed police response at a target’s home. Some people subjected to the group’s abuse have died by suicide.",
            "Sorrenti, who goes by “Keffals” online, has been leading a campaign to pressure Cloudflare to drop Kiwi Farms. In August, she fled her home in Canada for Europe after she was doxxed and swatted. Her online stalkers, however, found her in Belfast, Ireland, as well and continued to intensify their harassment campaign against her just as her campaign against Kiwi Farms and its enablers was gaining momentum.",
            "“When a multi-billion dollar corporation like Cloudflare has to drop Kiwi Farms because of an ‘imminent and emergency threat to human life’ it is no longer a matter of free speech. Removing Kiwi Farms from the internet is a matter of public safety for every single person online,” she tweeted on Saturday.",
            "On Sunday, Kiwi Farms was inaccessible. But a version of the site with a .ru domain name was intermittently up and running, though it was not clear whether it would remain up.",
            "The decision to drop Kiwi Farms Saturday was an about-face for Cloudflare and Prince, who earlier in the week put out a 2,600-word blog post — without mentioning the site by name — doubling down on the decision to protect it and comparing Cloudflare to a phone company that “doesn’t terminate your line if you say awful, racist, bigoted things.”",
            "But Sorrenti and other targets of the site say it was far worse than that, as trolls on the site relentlessly pursued their victims offline — often for years on end.",
            "“They are trying to get people to lose their jobs. They’re trying to get people to lose their housing, to be starving and homeless,” Liz Fong-Jones, a former Google engineer and cloud computing expert who is transgender, told the AP last week. “And then they go after people’s families and then they tell people that the only way out is to kill themselves.”",
            "Moon started Kiwi Farms nearly a decade ago as a wiki site dedicated to harassing a transgender woman; Moon even used the woman’s initials in an early version of the site’s name. Over time its users began to target other people ― mostly active online users who are transgender, have autism or other mental conditions. Kiwi Farms in its current form was born in 2015.",
            "An overarching theme of the site’s discussions centers on users’ fierce opposition to transgender children receiving gender-affirming medical care. Members typically refer to those who support such treatment as “groomers” and “pedophiles,” rhetoric that is also used increasingly by conservatives in their opposition to LGBTQ rights.",
            "“There has never been a violent incident in our history, which cannot be said for many other sites still on Cloudflare. This narrative feels like a lie spun up to save face,” Moon, who posts on Kiwi Farms under the pseudonym “Null,” posted Saturday in response to Cloudflare’s cutoff. Reached earlier by The Associated Press to comment on the campaign against his site, Moon replied only “the press are scum.”",
            "KiwiFarms.ru is registered to and protected by the Russian company DDoS-Guard, whose customers have in the past included Russian government websites including the Defense Ministry and cybercriminal forums where stolen credit cards are bought and sold.",
            "Last year, DDoS-Guard protected the pro-Trump social media website Parler.com for a time after Amazon withdrew hosting services. KiwiFarms.ru was registered on July 12, suggesting Moon, was aware Cloudflare could drop his site and thus created a backup plan.",
            "DDoS-Guard did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment on Sunday. Kiwi Farms’ internet connection is provided by VegasNAP, a Las Vegas-based company that said in response to queries last week that it does not disclose information about its clients. Contacted again Sunday, the company did not immediately respond.",
            "“In the past, DDoS-Guard has been known to discontinue support for some seriously problematic websites, apparently as a result of press inquiries. That very well may happen again, in this instance, but I wouldn’t bet on it,” said independent internet expert Ron Guilmette. “Obviously, a lot has changed in the world since Feb. 24, 2022, and I do believe that, in general, Russians these days, and over the past 6 months in particular, have learned to care a whole lot less about what the rest of the world thinks of them and/or their actions.”"

            "UVALDE, Texas (AP) — Elsa Avila slid to her phone, terrified as she held the bleeding side of her abdomen and tried to stay calm for her students. In a text to her family that she meant to send to fellow Uvalde teachers, she wrote: “I’m shot.”",
            "For the first time in 30 years, Avila will not be going back to school as classes resume Tuesday in the small, southwest Texas city. The start of school will look different for her, as for other survivors of the May 24 shooting at Robb Elementary School in which 21 people died, with an emphasis on healing, both physically and mentally. Some have opted for virtual education, others for private school. Many will return to Uvalde school district campuses, though Robb Elementary itself will never reopen.",
            "“I’m trying to make sense of everything,” Avila said in an August interview, “but it is never going to make sense.”",
            "A scar down her torso brings her to tears as a permanent reminder of the horror she endured with her 16 students as they waited in their classroom for an hour for help while a gunman slaughtered 19 children and two teachers in two adjoining classrooms nearby.",
            "Minutes before she felt the sharp pain of the bullet piercing her intestine and colon, Avila was motioning students away from the walls and windows and closer to her. A student lined up by the door for recess had just told her something was going on outside: People were running — and screaming. As she slammed the classroom door so the lock would catch, her students took their well-practiced lockdown positions.",
            "Moments later, a gunman stormed into their fourth-grade wing and began spraying bullets before ultimately making his way into rooms 111 and 112.",
            "In room 109, Avila repeatedly texted for help, according to messages reviewed by The Associated Press. First at 11:35 a.m. in the text to her family that she says was meant for the teacher group chat. Then at 11:38 in a message to the school’s vice principal. At 11:45, she responded to a text from the school’s counselor asking if her classroom was on lockdown with: “I’m shot, send help.” And when the principal assured her that help was on the way, she replied simply: “Help.”",
            "“Yes they are coming,” the principal wrote back at 11:48 a.m.",
            "It’s unclear whether her messages were relayed to police. District officials did not respond to requests for comment on actions taken to communicate with law enforcement on May 24, and an attorney for then-Principal Mandy Gutierrez was not available for comment.",
            "According to a legislative committee’s report that described a botched police response, nearly 400 local, state and federal officers stood in the hallway of the fourth-grade wing or outside the building for 77 minutes before some finally entered the adjoining classrooms and killed the gunman. Lawmakers also found a relaxed approach to lockdowns — which happened often — and security concerns, including issues with door locks. State and federal investigations into the shooting are ongoing.",
            "The district is working to complete new security measures, and the school board in August fired the district’s police chief, Pete Arredondo. Residents say it remains unclear how — or even if — trust between the community and officials can be rebuilt, even as some call for more accountability, better police training and stricter gun safety laws.",
            "Avila recalls hearing the ominous bursts of rapid fire, then silence, then the voices of officers in the hallway yelling, “Crossfire!” and later more officers standing nearby.",
            "“But still nobody came to help us,” she said.",
            "As Avila lay motionless, unable to speak loud enough to be heard, some of her students nudged and shook her. She wished for the strength to tell them she was still alive.",
            "A light flashed into their window, but nobody identified themselves. Scared it might be the gunman, the students moved away.",
            "“The little girls closest to me kept patting me and telling me, ‘It’s going to be OK miss. We love you miss,’” Avila said.",
            "Finally, at 12:33 p.m. a window in her classroom broke. Officers arrived to evacuate her students — the last to be let out in the area, according to Avila.",
            "With her remaining strength, Avila pulled herself up and helped usher students onto chairs and tables and through the window. Then, clutching her side, she told an officer she was too weak to jump herself. He came through the window to pull her out.",
            "“I never saw my kids again. I know they climbed out the window and I could just hear them telling them, `Run, run, run!’” Avila said.",
            "She remembers being taken to the airport, where a helicopter flew her to a San Antonio hospital. She was in and out of care until June 18.",
            "Avila later learned that a student in her class was wounded by shrapnel to the nose and mouth but had since been released from medical care. She said other students helped their injured classmates until officers arrived.",
            "“I am very proud of them because they were able to stay calm for a whole hour that we were in there terrified,” Avila said.",
            "As her students prepare to return to school for the first time since that traumatic day, Avila is on the way to recovery, walking up to eight minutes at a time on the treadmill in physical therapy and going to counseling. She looks forward to teaching again someday.",
            "Outside of a shuttered Robb Elementary, a memorial for the people killed overflows at the entrance gate. Teachers from across Texas stopped by this summer to pay their respects and reflect on what they would do in the same situation.",
            "“If I survive, I have to make sure they survive first,” said Olga Oglin, an educator of 23 years from Dallas, her voice breaking.",
            "“Whatever happens to a student at our school, it just happens to one of my kids,” Olgin said, adding that as the person to greet parents, students and staff at the door in the mornings, she likely would be the first person shot.",
            "Ofelia Loyola, who teaches elementary school in San Antonio, visited with her husband, middle school teacher Raul Loyola. She was baffled at the delayed response from law enforcement, as seen on security and police video.",
            "“They are all kids. It doesn’t matter how old they are, you protect them,” she said.",
            "Last week, Avila and several of her students met for the end-of-year party they were unable to have in May. They played in the pool at a country club and she gave them each a bracelet with a little cross to remind them that “God was with us that day and they are not alone,” she said.",
            "“We always talked about being kind, being respectful, taking care of each other — and they were able to do that on that day,” Avila said.",

            "MADISON, Wis. (AP) — The Republican candidate for governor in Wisconsin endorsed by Donald Trump is calling for people to take up “pitchforks and torches” in reaction to a story that detailed his giving to anti-abortion groups, churches and others — rhetoric that Democrats say amounts to threatening violence.",
            "Tim Michels, who co-owns the state’s largest construction company, faces Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in the battleground state. If Michels wins, he will be in position to enact a host of GOP priorities passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature leading into the 2024 presidential election. Evers has vetoed more bills than any governor in modern state history and is campaigning on his ability to serve as a check on Republicans.",
            "Michels, a multimillionaire, this week reacted strongly to a story published by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel detailing charitable giving by him and his wife’s foundation, some of which went to anti-abortion groups and churches that have taken anti-gay positions.",
            "Since the story’s publication, Michels has gone after not just Evers and Democrats, but also the Journal Sentinel and, more broadly, all reporters.",
            "“I believe people should just, just be ready to get out on the streets with pitchforks and torches with how love the liberal media has become,” Michels said Thursday on a conservative talk radio show.",
            "“People need to decide: ‘Am I going to put up with this? Am I going to tolerate this, taking somebody that gives money to churches or cancer research and use that as a hit piece in the media?’ I’m appalled. It’s disgusting.”",
            "That’s further than he went in a campaign website posting on Thursday when he encouraged people to “Get involved. Push back. Speak up. Volunteer. Donate. Vote.”",
            "Evers’ spokesman, Sam Roecker, tweeted Friday that Michels had gone too far.",
            "“Instead of explaining why he’s funding groups working to ban access to abortion and contraception, Tim Michels is encouraging violence,” Roecker wrote. “He’s too radical for Wisconsin.”",
            "Hannah Menchoff, a Wisconsin Democratic Party spokesperson, accused Michels of threatening violence in an “extreme attempt to pander to Donald Trump and the MAGA base.”",
            "Michels’ campaign spokesperson, Anna Kelly, on Friday downplayed his comments.",
            "“Only political hacks and media accomplices would freak out about Tim using a figure of speech to emphasize the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s ridiculous characterization of his donations to churches, nuns, and charitable causes as ‘radical,’” she said.",
            "Michels, who has used the Journal Sentinel article in fundraising pleas, posted a lengthy response to the piece on his campaign website Thursday. He accused Evers and the “corrupt media” of turning his charitable giving and faith “into something malicious.”",
            "“I will never, ever apologize for giving to charitable causes, or for being a Christian,” Michels wrote. “However, the Journal Sentinel should be ashamed of their anti-religious bigotry.”",
            "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel executive editor George Stanley defended the article, noting that the paper ran a piece on the same day about security costs for the Democratic U.S. Senate candidate that his Republican opponent was urging people to read.",
            "“Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporters are independent of all political parties and special interest groups,” Stanley said. “We are committed to accuracy so citizens can make up their own minds and stay in charge of their government.”The Timothy and Barbara Michels Family Foundation donated $1.66 million in 2020 alone, the Journal Sentinel reported. The bulk of it, $1 million, went to Cornell University in New York. where a faculty member pioneered a rare surgery that saved the life of Michels’ daughter, who had a brain tumor at age 11.The Journal Sentinel published a story in March about that donation and the surgery that Michels’ daughter had. That was one month before Michels announced his run for governor.Michels also gave $175,000 to Wisconsin Right to Life, Pro Life Wisconsin Education Task Force and Avail NYC, a New York City crisis pregnancy center.Pro Life Wisconsin wants to outlaw abortion and ban most common forms of contraception and birth control. It also wants to prohibit in vitro fertilization.The Michels’ foundation also donated $10,000 to Christ Fellowship in Miami. The Journal Sentinel’s story noted that the church’s pastor, Omar Giritli, in June called arguments for exception to abortions in cases of rape or incest “deceptive reasoning.”The couple also donated $50,000 to Spring Creek Church in Pewaukee. Its pastor, Chip Bernhard, has suggested that people who have an abortion need forgiveness, and allowing transgender children to use the bathroom of their choice is “awful.”Kelly, Michels’ campaign spokesperson, did not immediately respond to questions about whether Michels supported those positions.Michels defended his giving to pregnancy resource centers, Wisconsin Right to Life and Pro Life Wisconsin, saying “we believe women who may feel overwhelmed by an unplanned pregnancy need and deserve compassion, love, support and options other than abortion.“I apologize for none of it,” Michels wrote."

            "Residents of Jackson, Mississippi, still don’t have widespread access to clean drinking water as of Sunday, after massive rains and river flooding late last month worsened existing infrastructure problems at one of the two treatment plants in the majority-Black city.",
            "Some officials said Saturday that service has been restored to most customers, but the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency warned on Sunday that it’s still “too early” to tell when the city will have widespread clean drinking water again.",
            "“As you said, there has been a lot of infrastructure damage that has been present for many years,” Deanne Criswell told Dana Bash on CNN’s “State of the Union.”",
            "“Where we are focused right now from FEMA is being able to make sure that we can provide and support the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency with bringing in safe drinking water, bottled water, supporting their operations ― but more importantly, bringing in our federal partners that can really understand what it’s going to take to bring this plant back to full operational capacity,” she said.",
            "Criswell said she visited Jackson on Friday with Mitch Landrieu, the White House’s infrastructure director. The FEMA director spoke with the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers about the assessments they’re conducting and what it’s going to take to make clean drinking water widely available to the community. The “boil water” notice is still in place due to the water treatment facility’s fragile state.",
            "“So it’s going to happen in phases, right? The focus right now is making sure we can get bottled water out. But also, we’re providing temporary measures to help increase the water pressure, so people can at least flush their toilets and use the faucets,” Criswell said. “The longer term and the mid-term about how long it’s going to take to actually make it safe to drink ― I think that we have a lot more to learn about what it’s going to take to get that plant up and running.”",
            "The city of about 150,000 does not have the finances to fix its water crisis, a result of the tax base eroding as the population decreased amid white flight that began a few years after public schools integrated in the 1970s. Today, Jackson is more than 80% Black and 25% poor ― which means the water crisis has disproportionately affected low-income and Black residents and businesses.",
            "Jackson’s Democratic mayor, Chokwe Antar Lumumba, has long blamed the city’s crumbling infrastructure on climate change and inaction from the state legislature ― a mostly white, conservative body. Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves (R) has blamed the problems on mismanagement by the city government.",
            "But on Sunday, neither Criswell nor Lumumba chose to directly answer questions about who exactly is to blame for the water crisis facing the city. Instead, they emphasized that the focus right now should be on coming together to ensure Jackson residents have the access to clean water they need.",
            "“I have to be optimistic. I have to make certain that we don’t let anybody off the hook and we continue to see this into its conclusion,” Lumumba told Martha Raddatz on ABC’s “This Week.” “And its conclusion won’t be even after water is restored this week and even after the ‘boil water’ notice is lifted.”",
            "“Its conclusion won’t take place until we can look the residents of Jackson in the face and say, you know, we have a greater sense of reliability, that we believe in this system, and we believe in the equity of this system and that certain portions of our city won’t be disproportionately affected by this, week in and week out,” he said."

The rising waters reached dangerous levels and posed a threat to a protective dyke and embankment, they said. The lake, located west of the Indus River, is the largest natural freshwater lake in Pakistan and one of the largest in Asia.",

The report said 453 children were among the dead.",

            "The renewed request for international aid came as Pakistan has received 35 planeloads of relief goods from Turkey, China, the United Arab Emirates, France, Uzbekistan and other countries.

            "UVALDE, Texas (AP) — One girl runs and hides when she sees thin people with long hair similar to the gunman who stormed into her Uvalde school and killed 21 people. One boy stopped making friends and playing with animals. A third child feels her heart race when she’s reminded of the May 24 massacre that killed a close friend — once at such a dangerous pace that she had to be rushed to a hospital, where she stayed for weeks.",
            "The 11-year-old girl has been diagnosed with anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. She and her family spoke to The Associated Press on condition her name not be used to protect her identity.",
            "“I never lost someone before,” she said, adding that her friend who was among the 19 students and two teachers killed in the United States’ deadliest school massacre in a decade would encourage her through hard times. “She was a very strong person.”",
            "As students get ready to return to school in Uvalde on Tuesday for the first time since the massacre at Robb Elementary, PTSD symptoms are starting to show. Parents are finding themselves unable to help, and experts worry because communities of color such as the largely Hispanic city of Uvalde face disparities in access mental health care. For low-income families, it can be even harder, as access to limited resources requires long waits for referrals through medical assistance programs such as Medicaid.",
            "“It’s hard hearing what these kids are going through at such a young age,” said Yuri Castro, a mother of two boys in Uvalde, whose cousin was killed in the shooting and whose sons were once taught by the two slain teachers. Castro knows of children so traumatized they have stopped speaking.",
            "School shootings dramatically upend survivors’ lives. For some, symptoms linger for years and high-quality treatment can be difficult to find.",
            "In recent years, Texas lawmakers have focused on spending money on mental health services, devoting more than $2.5 billion during the current fiscal year.",
            "But according to the 11-year-old girl’s family — lifelong residents of Uvalde — the only mental health center in the area — just blocks from Robb Elementary — was seldom used or discussed, raising worries about the lack of awareness regarding signs and symptoms of mental illness and the stigma surrounding seeking help.",
            "The mother of the 11-year-old girl whose racing heart led to her hospitalization says open conversations about mental health were previously taboo in the heavily Latino community, where culturally, mental health is brushed off as feeling lazy, bored or throwing a tantrum.",
            "“I remember growing up it was like, ‘Go over there, you are just being chiflada,’” the mother said, using a Spanish word that means “acting spoiled.”",
            "Now, she said, the town is waking up to the reality of mental health even as some people still ask why survivors like her daughter need help.",
            "Members of the community have been supporting one another by checking in with extended family and friends and taking advantage of community resources that have been set up, including counseling by the Red Cross and emotional support from the churches. The parents of one of the children who was killed started an organization that will be putting together wilderness retreats for victims’ families and survivors. Residents also have social media groups where they can share mental health resources and express their grief.",
            "The Texas Health and Human Services Commission contracted with organizations to create a mental health hotline that in six weeks responded to nearly 400 calls.",
            "Martha Rodriguez, who coordinated efforts to help students recover after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, said officials need to visit the community to make sure the right resources are available. She said addressing stigmas and sending providers who understand the families’ language and values are key.",
            "“Some families may not feel comfortable sharing distress and needs,” she said.",
            "Many families impacted by the shooting are Roman Catholic. The mother of a girl who survived the attack said her daughter has only been able to open up to a priest in Houston — 280 miles (450 kilometers) away — whom the family goes to see when they visit relatives.",
            "“This is going to be a long journey. This is not going to be something that we can just do some work and fix it,” said San Antonio Archbishop Gustavo García-Siller.",
            "Julie Kaplow, director of the trauma and grief centers at the Texas Children’s Hospital and Children’s Hospital New Orleans, said many students who survived the May 2018 Santa Fe High School shooting that killed 10 in suburban Houston did not exhibit symptoms for six months.",
            "“I am anticipating that we will see some similarities,” said Kaplow, who has been training clinicians and others who are treating families in Uvalde. “Part of the reason is those symptoms haven’t manifested yet and will start to manifest when they are reminded of the event itself. Or the caregiver starts to recognize, ‘Wait a minute my child is still not eating, is still not sleeping.’”",
            "The length of treatment varies depending on the severity of symptoms. For some, it can last up to two to three years.",
            "Melissa Brymer, director of terrorism and disaster programs at the UCLA-Duke National Center for Child Traumatic Stress, was the lead adviser to public schools in Newtown, Connecticut, after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary in 2012. She said officials need to make sure that families can get services at school. They also need to create spaces that feel friendlier, such as community meals, rather than clinics.",
            "Parents of the incoming fifth-grader who is struggling with symptoms chose to home-school her this year so she can continue going to appointments more easily. She is also getting a service dog who will alert her if her heart rate rises.",
            "But she worries about her brothers returning to the classroom and gets anxious thinking others will judge her because of how she has been affected by the massacre when she wasn’t shot, her mother said. She is awakened daily by night terrors.",
            "“We don’t sleep. ... We don’t even know what that is anymore since this has happened,” the mother said. “I am going to have to deal with that for however long it takes for her to heal.”"

Up to 12 inches of rain was estimated to have fallen in the area, according to Kemp’s executive order.",

            "The original series was filmed from 2002 to 2005 at the family’s Los Angeles home, where a cacophony of arguments between heavy metal icon Ozzy Osbourne and his wife, Sharon, as well as the teenage hijinks of their children Jack and Kelly, provided indelible chaos.",
            "“Twenty years ago, they shaped television for all of us — now they’re coming home at a different stage in their lives but with the promise of the same laughter, love and tears,” creative directors Ben Wicks and Colin Barr said in a press release. “We can’t wait to work with them and to share it with BBC One viewers in 2023.”",

            "Authorities believe the aircraft — a Beechcraft King Air C90A — was stolen and are working to determine whether the pilot who threatened to crash the plane is an employee of a local airport, two people briefed on the matter told The Associated Press.

            "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — NASA’s new moon rocket sprang another dangerous fuel leak Saturday, forcing launch controllers to call off their second attempt to send a crew capsule into lunar orbit with test dummies.",
            "The first attempt earlier in the week was also marred by escaping hydrogen, but those leaks were elsewhere on the 322-foot (98-meter) rocket, the most powerful ever built by NASA.",
            "There was no immediate word on when NASA might try again. After Tuesday, a two-week launch blackout period kicks in. Extensive fuel leak repairs could require that the rocket be hauled off the pad and back into its hangar, possibly pushing the flight into October.",
            "Launch director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson and her team tried to plug Saturday’s leak the way they did the last time: stopping and restarting the flow of super-cold liquid hydrogen in hopes of removing the gap around a seal in the supply line. They tried that twice, in fact, and also flushed helium through the line. But the leak persisted.",
            "Blackwell-Thompson finally halted the countdown after three to four hours of futile effort.",
            "“We have a scrub for the day,” announced NASA’s launch commentator, Derrol Nail.",
            "NASA wants to send the crew capsule atop the rocket around the moon, pushing it to the limit before astronauts get on the next flight. If the five-week demo with test dummies succeeds, astronauts could fly around the moon in 2024 and land on it in 2025. People last walked on the moon 50 years ago.",
            "After days of stormy weather, the weather cooperated early Saturday as the launch team began loading nearly 1 million gallons of fuel into the Space Launch System rocket.",
            "But minutes into the operation, hydrogen fuel began seeping from the engine section at the bottom of the rocket, violating safety rules.",
            "During Monday’s launch attempt, hydrogen fuel escaped from elsewhere in the rocket. Technicians tightened up the fittings over the past week, but Blackwell-Thompson cautioned that she wouldn’t know whether everything was tight until Saturday’s fueling.",
            "Even more of a problem on Monday, a sensor indicated one of the rocket’s four engines was too warm, but engineers later verified it actually was cold enough. The launch team planned to ignore the faulty sensor this time around and rely on other instruments to ensure each main engine was properly chilled.",
            "Mission managers accepted the additional risk posed by the engine issue as well as a separate problem: cracks in the rocket’s insulating foam. But they acknowledged other problems — like fuel leaks — could prompt yet another delay.",
            "That didn’t stop thousands from jamming the coast to see the Space Launch System rocket soar. Local authorities expected massive crowds because of the long Labor Day holiday weekend.",

            "MOSCOW (AP) — Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev is set to be buried Saturday in a ceremony falling short of a state funeral that will not be attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin or top international leaders.",
            "The relatively low-key funeral reflects the Kremlin’s uneasiness about the legacy of Gorbachev, who has been revered in the West for ending the Cold War but despised by many at home for the collapse of the Soviet Union and the ensuing economic meltdown that plunged millions into poverty.",
            "Putin privately laid flowers at Gorbachev’s coffin on Thursday because of what the Kremlin described as the president’s busy schedule that would prevent him from attending the funeral.",
            "Asked what specific business will keep Putin busy, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a conference call with reporters that the president will have a series of working meetings, an international phone call and must also prepare for attending a business forum in Russia’s Far East next week.",
            "Gorbachev, who died Tuesday at the age of 91, will be buried at Moscow’s Novodevichy cemetery next to his wife, Raisa, following a farewell ceremony at the Pillar Hall of the House of the Unions, an iconic mansion near the Kremlin that has served as the venue for state funerals since Soviet times.",
            "Despite the choice of the prestigious venue, the Kremlin stopped short of calling it a state funeral, with Peskov saying the ceremony will have “elements” of one, such as honorary guards, and the government’s assistance in organizing it. He wouldn’t describe how it will differ from a full-fledged state funeral.",
            "If the Kremlin had declared a state funeral for Gorbachev, it would have made it awkward for Putin to ignore the event. It would also have obliged the Kremlin to send invitations to foreign leaders, something that it was apparently reluctant to do amid soaring tensions with the West after sending troops into Ukraine.",
            "Putin, who once bemoaned the collapse of the Soviet Union as the “greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century,” has avoided explicit personal criticism of Gorbachev but has repeatedly blamed him for failing to secure written commitments from the West that would rule out NATO’s expansion eastward. The issue has marred Russia-West relations for decades and fomented tensions that exploded when the Russian leader sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24.",
            "In a carefully-phrased letter of condolence released Wednesday avoiding explicit praise or criticism, Putin described Gorbachev as a man who left “an enormous impact on the course of world history.”",
            "“He led the country during difficult and dramatic changes, amid large-scale foreign policy, economic and society challenges,” Putin said. “He deeply realized that reforms were necessary and tried to offer his solutions for the acute problems.”",
            "The Kremlin’s ambivalence about Gorbachev was mirrored in state television broadcasts, which paid tribute to Gorbachev as a historic figure but described his reforms as poorly planned and held him responsible for failing to properly defend the country’s interests.",
            "The Russian public has remained similarly divided over Gorbachev’s legacy, with some praising him for ending the Cold War and shedding seven decades of totalitarian rule and others accusing him of betrayal.",

            "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — NASA aimed for a Saturday launch of its new moon rocket, after fixing fuel leaks and working around a bad engine sensor that foiled the first try.",
            "The inaugural flight of the 322-foot (98-meter) rocket — the most powerful ever built by NASA — was delayed late in the countdown Monday. The Kennedy Space Center clocks started ticking again as managers expressed confidence in their plan and forecasters gave favorable weather odds.",
            "Atop the rocket is a crew capsule with three test dummies that will fly around the moon and back over the course of six weeks — NASA’s first such attempt since the Apollo program 50 years ago. NASA wants to wring out the spacecraft before strapping in astronauts on the next planned flight in two years.",
            "NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said he’s more confident going into this second launch attempt, given everything engineers learned from the first try.",
            "So is astronaut Jessica Meir, who’s on NASA’s short list for one of the initial moon crews.",
            "“We’re all excited for this to go, but the most important thing is that we go when we’re ready and we get it right, because the next missions will have humans on board. Maybe me, maybe my friends,” Meir told The Associated Press on Friday.",
            "The engineers in charge of the Space Launch System rocket insisted Thursday evening that all four of the rocket’s main engines were good and that a faulty temperature sensor caused one of them to appear as though it were too warm Monday. The engines need to match the minus-420 degrees Fahrenheit (minus-250 degrees Celsius) of the liquid hydrogen fuel at liftoff, otherwise they could be damaged and shut down in flight.",
            "“We have convinced ourselves without a shadow of a doubt that we have good-quality liquid hydrogen going through the engines,” said John Honeycutt, the rocket’s program manager.",
            "Once fueling begins Saturday morning, the launch team will perform another engine test — this time earlier in the countdown. Even if that suspect sensor indicates the one engine is too warm, other sensors can be relied on to ensure everything is working correctly and to halt the countdown if there’s a problem, Honeycutt told reporters.",
            "NASA could not perform that kind of engine test during dress rehearsals earlier this year because of leaking fuel. More fuel leaks cropped up Monday; technicians found some loose connections and tightened them.",
            "The engine-temperature situation adds to the flight’s risk, as does another problem that cropped up Monday: cracks in the foam insulation of the rocket. If any foam pieces break off at liftoff, they could strike the strap-on boosters and damage them. Engineers consider the likelihood of that happening low and have accepted these slight additional risks.",
            "“This is an extremely complicated machine and system. Millions of parts,” NASA’s chief, Nelson, told the AP. “There are, in fact, risks. But are those risks acceptable? I leave that to the experts. My role is to remind them you don’t take any chances that are not acceptable risk.”",
            "The $4.1 billion test flight is NASA’s first step in sending astronauts around the moon in 2024 and landing them on the surface in 2025. Astronauts last walked on the moon in 1972.",

            "WASHINGTON (AP) — America’s employers slowed their hiring in August in the face of rising interest rates, high inflation and sluggish consumer spending, all of which have weakened the outlook for the economy.",
            "The government reported Friday that the economy added 315,000 jobs last month, down from 526,000 in July and below the average gain of the previous three months. The unemployment rate rose to 3.7%, from a half-century low of 3.5% in July, as more Americans came off the sidelines to look for jobs and didn’t find work immediately.",
            "The smaller August gain will likely be welcomed by the Federal Reserve. The Fed is rapidly raising interest rates to try to cool hiring and wage growth, which have been consistently strong. Businesses typically pass the cost of higher wages on to their customers through higher prices, thereby fueling inflation.",
            "Fed officials hope that by raising borrowing costs across the economy, they can reduce inflation from a near-40-year high. Some economists fear, though, that the Fed is tightening credit so aggressively that it will eventually tip the economy into recession.",
            "Job openings remain high and the pace of layoffs low, indicating that most businesses still want to hire and that the economy isn’t likely in, or even close to, a recession. The broadest measure of the economy’s output — gross domestic product — has shrunk for two straight quarters, meeting one informal definition of a recession.",
            "Most economists, though, don’t think a recession will have begun until the unemployment rate has risen steadily. Even so, worries about a forthcoming recession have grown after Fed Chair Jerome Powell, in a high-profile speech last week, made clear that to curb inflation, the Fed was prepared to continue raising short-term interest rates for the foreseeable future and to keep them elevated. Powell warned that the Fed’s inflation fight would likely cause pain for Americans in the form of a weaker economy and job losses.",
            "The Fed chair also said the job market is “clearly out of balance,” with demand for workers “substantially exceeding” the available supply. Friday’s jobs figures and a report earlier this week that the number of job openings rose in July after three months of declines, suggested that the Fed’s rate hikes so far haven’t restored any such balance. There are roughly two advertised job openings for every unemployed worker.",
            "The central bank has raised its short-term rate to a range of 2.25% to 2.5% this year, after the fastest series of increases since it began using its short-term rate to influence the economy in the early 1990s. It has projected that its key rate will reach a range of 3.25% to 3.5% by year’s end. Those rate hikes have made borrowing and spending steadily more expensive for individuals and businesses. The housing market, in particular, has been weakened by higher loan rates.",
            "The jobs figures are helping fill out the economic backdrop as this fall’s congressional elections intensify. Republicans have pointed to high inflation to try to pummel Democrats in midterm campaigns. The Biden administration has pushed back and claimed credit for a robust pace of job growth.",
            "Wages are rising at their fastest pace in decades as employers scramble to fill jobs at a time when fewer Americans are working or seeking work in the aftermath of the pandemic. Average hourly pay jumped 5.2% in July from a year earlier. Still, that was less than the 5.6% year-over-year in March, which was the largest annual increase in 15 years of records outside of the spring of 2020, when the pandemic struck.",
            "Some skeptics warn that the Fed may be focusing excessively on the strength of the job market when other indicators indicate that the economy is noticeably weakening. Consumer spending, for example, and manufacturing have slowed. The central bank might raise rates too far as a result, to the point where it causes a deeper recession than might be needed to conquer inflation.",
            "The economic picture is highly uncertain, with the healthy pace of hiring and low unemployment at odds with the government’s estimate that the economy shrank in the first six months of this year, which is one informal definition of a recession.",
            "Yet a related measure of the economy’s growth, which focuses on incomes, shows that it is still expanding, if at a weak pace.",
            "So far, the Fed’s rate hikes have severely dented the housing market. With the average rate on a 30-year mortgage reaching 5.66% last week — double the level of a year ago — sales of existing homes have fallen for six straight months.",
            "Consumers have moderated their spending in the face of much higher prices, though they spent more in July even after adjusting for inflation. But companies’ investment in new equipment has slowed, indicating they have an increasingly cautious outlook on the economy."

            "A Texas woman who made headlines after insisting that her unborn child counted as a second passenger when she was pulled over in a high occupancy vehicle lane earlier this summer was ticketed for the same reason again a few weeks later, authorities said.",
            "Brandy Bottone, 32, was stopped about a month after her first HOV citation, which was reported back in July. This second citation remains pending, the Dallas County district attorney’s office confirmed to HuffPost Thursday.",
            "Bottone, in an interview with the Dallas Morning News this week, said she wasn’t trying to make a statement by continuing to use the HOV lane after her first $215 citation, which she said was eventually dismissed. She was simply trying to get where she needed to go.",
            "“Nobody is answering whether it’s right or wrong,” she told the local paper of her ability to use the lane. “They dismissed it. Why do I have to change my belief? ... It doesn’t answer the question. Did I get it right or did I get it wrong?”",
            "Bottone, who did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment, had previously said that during her first stop she referenced the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade to the deputy for her belief that her unborn daughter counted as her second passenger. She also referred to the Texas Penal Code, which identifies an unborn child “at every stage of gestation” as an individual.",
            "The traffic rule requires “two or more people” to be in a vehicle when driving in an HOV lane, according to the Texas Department of Transportation’s website.",
            "In a perhaps bizarre twist of fate, Bottone said that during her second stop, she was pulled over by the same Dallas County sheriff’s deputy and at the same location while driving on Highway 75.",

            "For most parents and babies, breast milk comes in two forms: liquid and solid ice. If you’re pumping or expressing breast milk, it needs to be used within four hours of leaving your body, or it can be kept refrigerated for up to four days or kept frozen for six to 12 months, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
            "But there is a third, lesser-known option: Some companies offer services that will freeze-dry your breast milk as a powder, similar to formula.",
            "This is accomplished by removing water from the milk via a process called sublimation. First, the milk is frozen in a specialized chamber at a very low temperature: minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, much colder than your kitchen freezer. Then a pump takes air out of the chamber, decreasing the pressure.",
            "Next, the temperature is gradually raised back up, causing the ice crystals to vaporize. The powder that is left behind can be reconstituted by simply adding the correct proportion of water before serving.",
            "But should you freeze-dry your breast milk? Here are the most common questions about the process and how to figure out if it’s right for you.",
            "Why do people freeze-dry their milk?",
            "According to two companies that offer freeze-drying services, freeze-drying makes the milk shelf-stable and usable for up to three years. You don’t need to keep it in the refrigerator or freezer.",
            "Removing the water from the milk also decreases its weight. If you’re pumping exclusively and have to lug full bottles and ice packs with you everywhere, you’ll understand the appeal. This also allows you to ship freeze-dried milk long distances at a lower cost, without worrying about it accidentally thawing and spoiling.",
            "Frequent travel for work, concerns about milk expiring, worries about losing a stash or simply wanting freezer space back are some of the common reasons that parents decide to freeze-dry, said Berkley Luck, a co-founder of Milkify, a Houston-based business for freeze-drying breast milk. Military parents, who on short notice may have to pick up and move everything — including a stuffed freezer — have also made use of the service.",
            "Some parents say that a baby who doesn’t like the taste of a parent’s frozen and defrosted milk will more readily take freeze-dried milk, according to Luck and Janna Hattingh, the owner of Booby Food, a company in Canada’s Alberta province that also freeze-dries breast milk.",
            "Is it safe?",
            "Freeze-drying foods is not new, but the companies using the process for breast milk are. There is limited research into the practice, and companies that freeze-dry breast milk fall under the category of “autologous use” — meaning that each client only receives their own milk. They are not directly regulated by the FDA.",
            "“Right now there aren’t specific safety regulations, and [freeze-drying] is not yet recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics or Centers for Disease Control,” Dr. Jen Trachtenberg, a pediatrician, told HuffPost.",
            "“It is important for it to be reconstituted properly to ensure adequate nutrition for baby,” she added. This also holds true for infant formula.",
            "In Canada, Alberta Health Services also does not recommend the use of freeze-dried breast milk “due to the lack of available evidence,” according to a statement on its website.",
            "In the same statement, the provincial health authority said it did give a food handling permit to an unnamed business that freeze-dries clients’ breast milk. Hattingh told HuffPost that “Alberta health inspectors do physically come and visit our facility.”",
            "Luck from Milkify told HuffPost that they voluntarily follow so-called Current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations from the Food and Drug Administration and that they follow CDC guidelines for the safe handling of breast milk, as well as guidelines from the Human Milk Banking Association of North America. Booby-Licious, a company that launched in June and is also based in Texas, said the same in an email to Huffpost.",
            "However, because the services aren’t regulated by the FDA, parents should consider potential risks.",
            "Does the milk retain its beneficial properties?",
            "While freeze-drying human milk is not a widespread practice, some research has focused on the topic. A 2014 study found that most of the nutrients, vitamins and proteins are preserved in the freeze-drying process, though with some loss of vitamin C.",
            "“The overall caloric density of breast milk is not altered by freeze-drying,” Luck said. “In addition, proteins, fats and carbohydrates — including human milk oligosaccharides — were found to be protected by freeze-drying.”",
            "This is noteworthy, as the nutritional content of human milk is impacted by regular freezing, with protein and caloric content decreasing over time.",
            "Many of the beneficial antibodies in the milk appear to survive freeze-drying as well. A 2016 study found that 75% to 80% of certain antibodies were preserved when freeze-drying milk at particular temperatures.",
            "Meanwhile, a 2015 study showed that freeze-drying did not impact the “bactericidal activity” of human milk, meaning that it still inhibited the growth of dangerous bacteria.",
            "Researchers don’t know whether every component of human milk is preserved by freeze-drying (or by old-fashioned freezing, for that matter), as we don’t even know what all of them are and they differ from person to person. That said, there’s some evidence that freeze-drying is at least as good at preserving milk as freezing, and the milk may last much longer.",
            "Can people freeze-dry breast milk themselves?",
            "Multiple sources warn against freeze-drying milk on your own.",
            "“There may be potential for contaminants in the freeze-drying process or storage, and it is not something I would recommend families to do themselves at home,” said Trachtenberg, the pediatrician.",
            "People considering freeze-drying their milk with a dedicated company should do their due diligence with research and choose the company that best addresses their safety concerns.",
            "“You need somebody with the specialized equipment and specialized skill set to be able to do it for you so that it’s done safely and packaged safely, and can be stored with peace of mind,” Luck said.",
            "How does it work?",
            "Karrie Locher, a postpartum nurse and mother of four in St. Louis, used Booby Food to freeze-dry some of her milk.",
            "“I was incredibly worried about the international shipping,” Locher told HuffPost. But she decided to go with Booby Food because Milkify, which was closer to her home, didn’t have any availability.",
            "Locher said that the most nerve-wracking part of the process was shipping the milk that she’d worked so hard to collect. Those who live near the freeze-drying companies can circumvent this step by using their local drop-off services.",
            "“I was sent a ‘breast milk shipper,’ which consisted of a box, insulated cooler and prepaid shipping label inside. I packed up my frozen milk per the instructions and shipped it through FedEx,” said Locher.",
            "“The owner [Hattingh] tracked it with me and assured me it would be just fine. She takes the cooler temps when it gets to her, and all of my milk was still frozen solid when it arrived,” Locher added.",
            "Locher said she is saving most of her freeze-dried milk for later since it will last so long, but her son drank a bottle without issue and even ate some that she sprinkled into his dinner one evening.",
            "A difference between the three North American companies HuffPost found is that Milkify and Booby-Licious both say they process milk one bag at a time, with each becoming a bag of freeze-dried powder that has its own water ratio for serving.",
            "Booby Food, meanwhile, pools all of a person’s milk and divides the freeze-dried powder evenly into bags that have the same water ratio.",
            "“Their water ratio is unique to their breast milk, and they don’t have to filter through different bags to find the right amount they need,” said Hattingh.",
            "How much do freeze-drying services cost?",
            "Milkify charges $179 to process 100-120 ounces of milk, or $1.49 to $1.79 per ounce. Right now, the company is at capacity and clients can only place preorders for later. But it has a new, larger facility under construction that should allow it to process orders more quickly.",
            "Booby Food’s services cost 249.99 Canadian dollars ($190) for up to 100 ounces of milk, or about CA$2.50 per ounce, with payment plans available.",
            "Booby-Licious charges $210 for 100-120 ounces of milk, or $1.75-$2.10 per ounce.",
            "All three companies offer different pricing for greater quantities of milk.",
            "By comparison, a 21-ounce canister of Earth’s Best Organic infant formula on Amazon costs $27.82, or $1.32 per ounce. A 28.3-ounce canister of Enfamil formula is $41.99, or $1.48 per ounce.",
            "What other options do I have for extra breast milk?",
            "Even if it’ll be good for a few years, there may not be an advantage to freeze-drying milk that you’re never going to need. If you have a full freezer of meticulously collected liquid gold that you can’t bear to throw away, there are other options.",
            "You can donate it to a milk bank that will process it for premature infants at hospitals. Find your closest milk bank on the Human Milk Banking Association of North America website and call to inquire about screening and donation.",
            "If a milk bank can’t take your milk, perhaps because it has been in your freezer for too long — some won’t take milk after three months — you can still donate it informally to another parent. Ask in your local parenting groups on social media if anyone is looking for donated milk, or check the Human Milk 4 Human Babies or Eats on Feets pages. Be aware that there is some risk involved in informal milk donations, primarily for the recipient."

            "A photo of the bronze marker appears in a report that was released in August by the Naming Commission, which was tasked with reviewing Department of Defense assets that commemorate the Confederacy and provide renaming or removal recommendations.",
            "The plaque depicts a person in a hood, holding a weapon, with the words “Ku Klux Klan” beneath it. It appears on a larger piece of artwork called a triptych at the entrance to Bartlett Hall.",
            "The U.S. Military Academy’s public affairs office said in a statement that the part of the artwork that shows the KKK member is in a small section under the panel titled “One Nation, Under God, Indivisible.”",
            "The artwork was dedicated in 1965 to West Point graduates who served in World War II and Korea, the statement said.",

The Academy continues to graduate its most diverse classes ever with respect to ethnicity, gender, experience, and background.”",
            "The commission said it had visited West Point and worked with leaders and historians to identify assets like the plaque. However, the commission said it did not have the authority to recommend the removal of the plaque as it’s not specifically a Confederate monument and thus falls out of its remit.",

            "OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — An unprecedented red tide in the San Francisco Bay Area is killing thousands of fish and other marine life whose carcasses are washing ashore, creating a foul odor that experts say could get worse during this weekend’s expected heat wave.",
            "At Oakland’s Lake Merritt, a popular spot for joggers, walkers and those looking to be in nature, crews on Wednesday began removing dead crabs, bat rays, striped bass and other fish that began piling up on its rocky shores over the weekend.",
            "The fish die-off at Lake Merritt and throughout the Bay Area may be due to a harmful algae bloom that has been spreading in the region since late July, said Eileen White, executive officer of San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board.",
            "“We normally have algae blooms during the summertime. But what’s unusual about this one is how large it is and the fact that there are fish kills,” White said.",
            "Most algae blooms end after a week or so. But a triple-digit heat wave forecast for the holiday weekend may help the Bay Area’s grow even more, White said. She said that reports of dead fish started coming in last week.",
            "“This was a natural occurrence of Mother Nature and so, we don’t know when it’s going to end,” she said",
            "A microorganism called Heterosigma akashiwo formed a bloom first spotted in the Alameda Estuary, White said. It is present in the bay all the time, but scientists are trying to determine what caused it to spread so far and wide and for so many weeks.",
            "They say a years-long drought has prevented stagnant water from flowing into the ocean and unseasonably warm and sunny weather may be helping the algae spread.",
            "Jon Rosenfield, a scientist with the San Francisco Baykeeper conservation group, said high levels of nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen in wastewater also drive the growth of algae blooms.",
            "“The only lever that we have to control the problem is to reduce nutrients put into the bay from the 40 wastewater treatment plants that operate around the bay,” he said.",
            "Rosenfield said sewage treatment plants are cleaning the water of solid material and bacteria, but they’re not designed to pull out nitrogen and phosphorus.",
            "Treating the water for nutrients would cost billions of dollars, and those costs would be passed on to residents, White said. She said water districts are funding studies to understand the effects of nutrients that have been present in the water since people settled in the area.",
            "“The goal is to make the appropriate regulations based on sound science,” White said.",
            "Experts are also trying to determine what exactly is killing the fish.",
            "Algae blooms produce a toxin that is lethal to fish and other marine life, and as they spread, bacteria in the water start to consume the algae. As it decays, it depletes the water of oxygen, leading the fish to suffocate, Rosenfield said.",
            "“Which of those mechanisms is operating here, the toxin or the low dissolved oxygen? We just don’t know yet,” he said.",
            "Algae bloom has been reported in Contra Costa and Marin counties to the north and San Mateo County to the west. In the South Bay, concentrations of chlorophyll — an indicator of algae density —measured on Aug. 10 were the highest observed in more than 40 years, White said.",
            "In Oakland, people turned to social media to post photos of some of the thousands of dead fish at Lake Merritt, where visitors have started complaining about the stench.",
            "“It doesn’t smell very good right now, so it’s a bit of a nuisance,” said Graham Webster, who jogs around the lake once or twice a week.",
            "“But the bigger question is what’s happening to the lake and the bay? And what’s causing it? Is it our fault? Can it be fixed?” he asked.",
            "White said the algae aren’t known to be toxic to people, but they can cause skin and eye irritation. Her office is recommending people and pets stay out of any water that looks reddish-brown.",
            "Cely Aquino said she visits Lake Merritt regularly and seeing all the dead fish was sad.",
            "“I saw a lot of the dead fish, and I saw a couple of stingrays that were dead also. It’s pretty sad,” she said. “But I figure nature it’s going to take care of it all.”",

            "To make a great radio hit in 1994, it often came down to marketing — from the perfectly packaged music video and the artist’s image, to their uniformed styling or choreography. Essentially, whatever was amenable to popular culture.",
            "Think Boyz II Men’s “I’ll Make Love To You,” Ace of Base’s “The Sign,” Aerosmith’s “Crazy” and Salt-N-Pepa featuring En Vogue’s “Whatta Man.” These were and remain classic songs; they also were made to fit neatly inside the nebulous realm of pop music.",
            "Then there was 26-year-old Lisa Loeb, the soft-voiced singer-songwriter who rippled through the mainstream with a look and sound defying all pretension in a music video that is mostly her walking around singing deeply personal lyrics in a virtually empty apartment.",
            "Nothing about the video for “Stay (I Missed You)” was typical for its time. Not its wistful yet accessible guitar riff, not the fact that it became the lead single of the “Reality Bites” soundtrack when Loeb was still an unsigned artist, or that the movie’s star Ethan Hawke directed it, not Loeb’s clothes and certainly not her quiet indignation.",
            "Wearing a black short-sleeved minidress, matching tights and cat-eyed glasses, Loeb looked into the camera and sang: “You say I talk so all the time” — taking an oh-so-brief pause before defiantly continuing — “So?”",
            "It was that gentle confrontation, coupled with Loeb’s fierce individuality and the simplicity of her music — in actuality, it was far more complex than it sounded — for which she became known. That and her ever-present guitar.",
            "“You can see one of my guitars back there,” Loeb gestures behind her on a recent video call from her Los Angeles home. Looking at her through the Zoom screen, it’s almost like a whole 28 years haven’t passed by. She still wears feline-shaped eyeglasses, still expresses herself softly, yet firmly and still wears short skirts and dresses.",
            "In fact, in one of our two conversations she donned a pink flared miniskirt and a white blouse. “I like wearing short skirts,” she says plainly. “It’s comfortable. I feel strong in them. They are cute.”",
            "And she looked confident in them, mostly because they were and are obviously still uniquely her. But thinking about this idea of having a distinct identity as a musician inside of the gumball machine that was often ’90s pop music, it’s a wonder how an alternative rock artist like Loeb could have ever existed inside of it while actively pushing against it at the same time.",
            "For instance, she didn’t flirt with the camera or sing about sex. She wasn’t a part of a harmonizing girl group singing songs someone else wrote, often through the male gaze. She wore clothes that were, yes, unexpected but were her own decision.",
            "Listeners could have projected feminist messages onto her songs because she was a woman boldly singing her truth though lyrics she penned with music she also wrote. But really, it was because almost everything she did musically was specific to her in a music landscape that took great leaps to structure groups of artists to look and sound a certain way.",
            "But that wasn’t who Loeb was. When I asked her about whether she was even trying to make this kind of mark, she smiled and thought of a quote from John Knowles’ “A Separate Peace.” “‘Most of all, he did not want to be like most people were,’” she recited. “‘That is, eaten alive by a half-life semi-lived.’”",
            "This quiet resistance meant that record companies often didn’t know what to do with her or which genre to put her in (she was often categorized as a pop artist, though she identifies as an alternative rock musician).",
            "“People think, ‘Oh, you’re this quiet, shy, pop singer who’s got this one song,’” she said. “Well, I have a rock band and an orchestra, and I had all different kinds of things. I feel like often there was so much more going on beyond the thin layer of what was presented to us on pop radio.”",
            "And yet, she was subjected to some of the same run-of-the-mill objectification that every woman with a radio hit experienced. The press targeted her for what she wore. She was constantly contending with other people’s expectations.",
            "Loeb said she remembered thinking at the time if people would think she was trying to be “too sexy” and not take her seriously.",
            "“Why should I even have to worry if people are taking me seriously or not?”",
            "Because female musicians back then, and still today, weren’t just regarded by their songs.",
            "It was the entire package around those songs, including the women themselves. Of course women like Loeb ― who sang, wrote and arranged their own songs at a time when that was still considered rare ― were going to feel a way about being picked apart for reasons unrelated to their music.",
            "“That’s the world and feminism and people making judgments on you — about who you are, how you look, what you do,” she said.",
            "Today, 54-year-old Loeb looks back at this time with gratitude. She did, after all, have huge success despite all the industry challenges. It was, as she put it, an “exciting” time.",
            "She was constantly creating and performing. “Stay” catapulted to the No. 1 spot on the charts and was nominated for a Grammy. She was among many artists to perform at Lilith Fair, a concert made up of all-female musicians, including Jewel and Tracy Chapman and formed by fellow singer-songwriter Sarah MacLachlan.",
            "But there was a competitiveness that formed around women musicians back then that was exacerbated by the fact that mostly male gatekeepers would feel like one female artist was more than enough. “They were playing one woman on a radio station, and they said, ‘Oh, we already have Sheryl Crow,’” Loeb said. “‘We don’t have space for you,’ which is crazy.”",
            "Like with everything else, it became a learning experience for Loeb. “It’s a very either/or feeling, attitude. And that’s not really how musicians feel or think.” She connected with and was ultimately inspired by her female contemporaries while realizing they were going through some of the same things.",
            "“Even with having plenty of insecurities — let me tell you, there was something inside me that just felt confident,” she emphasized. “I think one of the big things was realizing everybody’s got shyness or insecurities. You feel empowered to realize that you have so much in common.”",
            "That sense of self could perhaps be attributed to growing up a “quiet, shy, tiny little girl” (she’s 5 feet, 2 inches tall) in Dallas, going to an all-girls school, or being able to look to other women like the members of Heart and Olivia Newton-John, or female contemporaries like Edie Brickell.",
            "Not only was she into female artistry that was a bit on the fringes, Loeb was also genuinely interested in women’s voices in music, especially since she started writing music at age 6, wrote her own lyrics and started playing the guitar by age 14.",
            "“In the ’70s when I was really growing up, there were a lot of women on the radio, in my mind,” she said, listing examples like Barbra Streisand and Dolly Parton. “But there have never been enough women.”",
            "This reality made Loeb even more determined to step out on her own and pave a road for herself. And because she “always has a million ideas” and so many interests — including, currently, reading audiobooks like Viola Davis’ memoir — she made sure she consumed as much information as she could about making music and the music industry at large.",
            "Loeb told me about when she and her high school friends, who, like her, would wear short skirts with shorts underneath, used to get into concerts through their affiliation with the indie record label I.R.S. Records and get backstage access to pick some of their favorite artists’ brains.",
            "“We’d interview the bands,” she said. “And we would film them with cameras. We were big fans. But also, my good friends and I were always approaching it from a journalistic standpoint. We’re also musicians, not groupies, but we’re really interested in behind the scenes.”",
            "So by the time “Stay” was released, Loeb had already been a musician for decades and had a good understanding of the way things worked as well as marketing and presentation.",
            "In other words, long before YouTube and Spotify gave underground artists today an avenue toward their creative freedom, Loeb was among many independent musicians already doing that by selling their cassette tapes and CDs on the street.",
            "“I had been performing and writing for years and years and recording,” Loeb said. “So, I had a lot of experience as an artist and an independent artist. I was promoting myself, [doing] PR, helping design album covers — all that kind of stuff. I was the leader of my band [Nine Stories].”",
            "“I wasn’t making music for the business of music,” she added. “But I wanted my music to get out there.”",
            "But who could ever really be prepared for the machine that was the mainstream recording industry in the ’90s? On one end, the male-dominated record labels undervalued Loeb’s keen understanding of how to market her own work.",
            "“I felt like the more organized and businesslike I was going into record company meetings, the less attention was paid to what I was saying,” Loeb said. “Nobody wanted to have a marketing meeting with me or discuss the business side of marketing.”",
            "As we were talking, Loeb always remained conscious about how her male counterparts faced their own challenges throughout the decade and doesn’t solely apply hers to being a woman. But she also doesn’t rule out how particularly gendered her experiences sound.",
            "“I think they responded better to people who were out of control,” she continued. “I was looked down upon because I like to look people in the eye when I spoke to them.”",
            "That was always the thing about Loeb that made her a bit of an outlier among some of the other female stars of pop radio at the time. She knew who she was as a person as well as a musician, and couldn’t accept being told otherwise. And that was true from day one.",
            "“I was not a big pop person,” Loeb said, thinking back to her youth. “I always liked alternative. I wouldn’t go to a mainstream movie. I wouldn’t listen to mainstream radio. And then all of a sudden, I was on mainstream radio.”",
            "As much as she and others “tried to mainstream our freedom musically in the ’90s,” as she described what she and others attempted to do, she was asked to focus on making a single for her follow-up album “Firecracker.” “I Do” released in 1997, and looked and sounded remarkably different from “Stay,” which was released just three years earlier.",
            "It’s poppier, obviously studio-produced without her band, and most of all, doesn’t sound like it came from someone who thrived on being an independent artist.",
            "“I was just so mad,” Loeb said. “I was just like, ‘I can’t believe this is happening.’”",
            "“My whole life — and I felt like I’d lived such a long life up until I was, I don’t know, in my late twenties — I had been writing songs forever and feeling so in control. And then, all of a sudden, for a record company to say I needed to write singles just made me so angry.”",
            "Loeb obviously did it, but as she put it, “I was almost like a petulant child. I was like, ‘Fine.’ There was a lot of, ‘Fine, I’ll do it.’”",
            "“I Do” is a much less complex song than her previous ones. And, like a good number of catchy pop songs still today, she realized that it became understood as a love song when it was about an artist being “frustrated” with her record company.",
            "“Years later I was listening to Sara Bareilles singing, ‘I’m not going to write you a love song,’” Loeb reflected. “I’m like, ‘This is such a great song.’ I’m like, ‘Sounds like a song about the record company.’ I looked it up — it was about the record company.”",
            "There was always this “weird push and pull,” as Loeb described it in the ’90s. Because on one hand, you wanted to get your music out. But in order to do so, gatekeepers in the ’90s would expect you to compromise who you were. That’s especially difficult for an independent artist.",
            "For instance, Loeb recalled when a stylist “convinced” her to wear a red spandex dress with mustard yellow tights and Mary Janes for a major publication. It was “such a stupid mistake,” she said. She absolutely hated it.",
            "“I don’t like mustard yellow,” she said. “But somehow, I said, ‘Okay,’ and wore the mustard yellow tights. That picture — to this day I’m like, ‘Why did I do that?’”",
            "If Loeb had her way, that picture would have looked more like one of the outtakes — her with a frying pan in her hand, curlers in her hair, wearing a tulle skirt (“I love anything tulle”), white tank top and full makeup. “That was me,” she said. “Turning things inside out.”",
            "But no matter how much she was quietly yet determinedly breaking barriers in some ways, she was still subjected to banal questions from the press about her appearance and not her songs. “For a while, I was like, ‘Talk about my songwriting and my guitar playing and my amps,’” she said. “People wanted to talk about my glasses.”",
            "Though her glasses weren’t “something cooked up in a marketing office” at the time (she actually needed her glasses to see), she now has her own eyewear line and in retrospect appreciates that they helped people identify her. “It’s an interest of mine,” she said. “So, why fight that?”",
            "But when Loeb recently looked through a number of old magazine articles about her that her mother kept all these years, she was shocked to realize how awful some journalists were.",
            "“They would say, like, ‘She’s so thin, she’s such a waif,’” Loeb said. “I’m like, ‘I’m excited that I’m in shape right now, and that I ate when I was hungry, and I stopped when I was full, and I’m able to eat ice cream and fit into my clothes. I like that.’”",
            "Loeb noted that several reporters that have recently interviewed her have begun their conversation by apologizing for what they wrote about her in the ’90s. Because they realize now that they weren’t fair to her.",
            "“Journalists were so snarky,” she said “I was like, ‘Wow, I’m surprised I’m still a musician today.’”",
            "“I have a very quiet, calm voice, but I must have very thick skin because people were mean,” she continued. “You would work so hard on these albums and arrangements and with your orchestras and your bands and your songwriting, and then people would just slap you down.”",
            "But Loeb, despite everything, is still here. By the end of the ’90s, she added professional acting to her resume with roles on “The Nanny” and in “House on Haunted Hill,” among others. Today, she is a mother and wife (to musician Roey Hershkovitz) who has expanded to acting on a dramatic podcast series like “Power Trip,” co-starring Tatiana Maslany.",
            "She’s still eager to learn and go to acting auditions and loves to reminisce about the ’90s. So much so that she also hosts a radio show, “90s on 9,” where she interviews ’90s-era musicians about their music and experiences.",
            "Loeb is still friends with many of her collaborators, both past and present, still performs sold-out concerts (she recently opened for Belinda Carlisle in Ireland), and regularly chats with fellow women musicians like Paula Abdul (whom she was just speaking with the day before we talked).",
            "She even earned her first Grammy in 2018 for Best Children’s Album, because she does those too.",
            "Back in the ’90s, Loeb often had a feeling of “dejection” over not feeling able to change the landscape of the music industry. “It was mostly the white men in charge,” she said. “Almost stereotypical, the idea that you’re fighting The Man. But literally, these were the people in charge of the music business.”",
            "But what remains her intention is having a life and a career that are entirely her own. “I wanted to live a life where I didn’t go back and say, ‘If only I had done what I wanted to do,’” she said.",
            "And so far, she has.",
            "“The proof is in the pudding,” she said. “You make it, you do it. You don’t let people tell you no. You band together when you can, if you need to, to break down barriers.”"

            "Yes, after the end of the Cold War, the former Russian leader chose to sell hot pizza as a way to raise money for a research foundation, according to a 1997 CNN article.",
            "“I’m in the process of creating a library and a perestroika archive, and this project requires certain funds,” Gorbachev said at the time. “Perestroika (restructuring) gave impetus to Russia and to the whole world. It is very important that everything that happened be preserved in these two centers.”",
            "While Gorbachev didn’t confirm how much he was paid, sources claimed he was reportedly paid nearly $1 million to do the advertisement, according to The New York Times. The commercial, which shows him dining at a Pizza Hut with his granddaughter Anastasia, debuted all over the world.",

            "Federal prosecutors on Tuesday revealed more explosive information about how former President Donald Trump and his team repeatedly failed to hand over classified documents, and how they may have even sought to obstruct the criminal investigation into the matter.",
            "How are members of his party responding to the government? By choosing to simply ignore the documents.",
            "A Twitter account run by the office of Rep. Jim Jordan (Ohio), the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, mocked a new photo prosecutors provided of some classified documents recovered at Trump’s estate because it included a box of framed Time magazine covers that featured Trump.",
            "Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee glossed over the documents marked “top secret,” which contain the most sensitive types of information, including some items related to the work of clandestine U.S. intelligence sources. The Department of Justice said that during the Aug. 8 search of Trump’s estate, in some instances, “even FBI counterintelligence personnel and DOJ attorneys conducting the review required additional clearances before they were permitted to review certain documents.”",
            "But House Judiciary Republicans found this all much ado about nothing. The FBI agents, they claimed in a follow-up tweet, staged a “photo op” and took the Time magazine covers “as a souvenir.”",
            "While other GOP lawmakers stayed silent immediately following the filing of DOJ’s brief late Tuesday night, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem (R) suggested the FBI was either lying or had somehow planted the documents at Trump’s estate ― a favorite conspiracy theory among conservatives.",
            "“You can see folders, you can see big words on ― do we know that that is really what President Trump brought to his home? Do we know that he put them there? Do we know what’s inside?” Noem posited in a Wednesday morning interview on Fox News.",
            "Noem is viewed as a potential 2024 presidential candidate and has already made several trips to early nominating states.",
            "These are only the latest GOP contortions in defense of Trump’s refusal to return classified documents to the government in potential violation of the Espionage Act. GOP lawmakers previously suggested that FBI agents went rogue during the search, that maybe aliens had something to do with it, and that the secrets weren’t that secret at all. And then there are their attempts to deflect by pointing to Hillary Clinton’s email server.",

Kristi Noem, a Trump ally, when Doocy brought up the FBI raid earlier this month on the former president’s home in Florida, which resulted in the confiscation of boxes of materials that included 11 packets of classified documents ― some of which were labeled with the highest classification markings.",
            "“Ultimately, it comes down to why did he have all that secret stuff at Mar-a-Lago?” Doocy asked. “I know his team has said they declassified it, but that’s news to the agencies that those documents belong to.”",
            "Investigators are looking at whether Trump violated several federal laws related to official and classified records, according to a redacted FBI affidavit released last week. Prosecutors with the Justice Department filed a 36-page brief late Tuesday detailing the sensitive documents found at Mar-a-Lago, as well as efforts by the former president and his team to obstruct their criminal investigation.",
            "Prosecutors included an image of some of the documents discovered when the FBI executed a search warrant at Trump’s residence. The photo shows five yellow folders on the floor marked top secret, as well as another that says “Secret SCI,” which means sensitive compartmentalized information. The remaining documents in the photo were edited to censor sensitive information.",
            "“Those are the biggest secrets in the world. And apparently the former president went through ’em in January,” Doocy said. “Why wouldn’t he say, ‘Oh, you know what? I really need to turn that back over.’ Why did he have all that stuff at Mar-a-Lago?”",
            "Noem responded by repeating Trump and his allies’ talking points that someone outside the Justice Department should investigate the incident in the name of “transparency.” The former president has requested a judge appoint a “special master” to review the confiscated documents to decide whether they should not be released due to “executive privilege” ― something prosecutors argue Trump does not have due to being a private citizen and it being the executive branch seeking the documents from him in the first place.",
            "“What is this information? We don’t know what was in there,” Noem said of the classified documents that, as their label insinuates, contain sensitive government information intentionally kept classified for national security reasons. The governor also suggested without evidence that the FBI was either lying or had planted the documents at Trump’s residence.",
            "“Let’s find out really what the process is, what is right, what’s precedent that other presidents have followed, and make sure this is done correctly.”",
            "“Governor,” Doocy responded, “I don’t think any president has ever carted off that many documents to their house after they left the presidency.”"

            "Three more accusers testified against R. Kelly before prosecutors rested their case on Tuesday during the third week of the singer’s federal trial in Chicago.",
            "In his latest trial, Kelly is accused of producing videos of child sexual abuse and attempting to recover footage potentially proving he sexually abused underage victims. Two of them, “Pauline” and “Tracy,” were protected by pseudonyms as they recounted their allegations Monday, Rolling Stone reported.",
            "Pauline said she was 14 when her friend “Jane” ― who testified earlier this month that Kelly abused her “hundreds” of times before she was 18 ― brought her to his home. Pauline testified she walked in on Kelly kneeling in front of her naked friend and that Kelly claimed he was combing her body for bruises.",
            "She said Kelly urged the two girls to kiss before the three engaged in sexual petting and oral sex, and that the incident wasn’t isolated. Pauline said these encounters, during which Kelly allegedly gave them alcohol, occurred at one of his homes, at his Chicago Trax recording studio, and on his tour bus in multiple states.",
            "She said Kelly had sex with her when she was 15.",
            "Tracy said she was a 16-year-old record label intern when she met Kelly in 1999. She said she initially declined his advances after being invited to his studio, but returned at a later date alongside her friend. Tracy said she told Kelly she was 16 before they started kissing, and he began masturbating.",
            "Tracy said Kelly “forced himself” on her in a hotel room the following week and had sex with her at his studio in the summer. She also detailed an alleged sexual encounter with Jane and Kelly during which she said she cried and Kelly told her “to stop being a baby” while he recorded the ordeal.",
            "Another accuser testified Tuesday under the pseudonym “Nia.” She said she met Kelly at an Atlanta mall in 1996 when she was a minor and the singer gave her his phone number. Nia said she told Kelly she was 15 during their third conversation. A few weeks later, he invited her to his concert.",
            "Nia said she was picked up in a limousine and taken to the Atlanta airport where she was given a “code” to board a plane for Kelly’s Minneapolis performance, as she had no passport or ID at the time. She said she was then taken to a hotel where Kelly asked her to undress the following day.",
            "Kelly then allegedly fondled her and masturbated before asking Nia to meet him in Chicago at a later date. She said Kelly sexually abused her in his studio there in the summer before he abandoned all contact. She was the last in a long line of witnesses before prosecutors rested their case.",
            "Judge Harry Leinenweber said proceedings will resume Thursday, when the defense will call witnesses as Kelly’s trial continues.",
            "In the current trial, Kelly is also facing other sexual abuse charges, as well as allegations he fixed a 2008 trial in Illinois. In June, the singer was convicted of sex trafficking and racketeering in a separate trial in New York and sentenced to 30 years in prison.",

            "In yet another troubling development for Donald Trump’s Truth Social media platform, stock values have taken a dive for the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that Truth Social is supposed to merge with to go public.",
            "CNBC reports that prices have fallen 16% this month, including an 8% dip Monday, after investors apparently got jittery about a delay in the planned merger of the SPAC — Digital World Acquisition Corp. — with Truth Social’s owner, Trump Media & Technology Group.",
            "Stocks were trading at $25.32 a share Monday, down significantly from their 2022 peak of about $97, according to CNBC.",
            "A Monday filing from Digital World said voting for a yearlong delay in the merger would open Tuesday. The current deadline to take Trump Media public is Sept. 8, but Digital World has warned that it could be forced to liquidate if the deadline is not extended. The company noted in an earlier filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it lost $6.5 million in the first half of the year.",
            "The latest development follows news that Truth Social is grappling with other money and trademark issues as Trump deals with various personal legal problems.",
            "RightForge, a major web-hosting operator, claimed last week that Truth Social owes some $1.6 million in contractually obligated payments, reported Fox Business.",
            "In another setback this month, Truth Social’s application for a trademark was turned down. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office found that Trump’s company name was “confusingly similar” to other entities.Digital World, already being investigated by the SEC over business dealings, also delayed its earning report earlier this month and warned in a filing last week that a dip in Trump’s popularity could hurt the business. The Washington Post has reported that Truth Social’s U.S. audience has plunged to about 300,000 views a day, down from nearly 1.5 million when it launched.The site is largely a platform for Trump, with heavy censorship, researchers and critics have found. Detractors say users are better served on competing right-wing social media sites like Telegram, Parler and Gab where there is a greater sense of a developed community with more discussion.Trump has posted a number of messages on Truth Social calling all negative information about his company in the media “fake news.” He has also posted messages asking people to join the site."

            "Nighttime is meant to be a period of peace and quiet — restful evenings, pleasant dreams and rejuvenation before another day. But, when you deal with teeth grinding, that probably isn’t the case. You end up with pain, tooth issues, and you may even wake up a little tired.",
            "Plus, when you deal with teeth grinding ― or bruxism, as it’s known medically ― you will likely deal with repercussions that go way beyond the anticipated tooth pain and damage.",
            "“Your dental health can affect your medical health,” said Dr. Floretta Cuffey-Terry, president of Robert T. Freeman Dental Society in Washington, D.C. If you are a chronic tooth grinder, you may experience adjacent issues that range from nutrition problems to an onslaught of stress.",
            "Here, experts share the signs you should look out for if you think you may be grinding your teeth at night, along with some advice on how to address it.",
            "Headaches",
            "If you spend your sleeping hours grinding your teeth, it’s highly likely that you’ll end up with headaches as a result of that pressure in your mouth and jaw, said Dr. Albert Coombs, owner of Smile Services DC and member of the international dental implant association.",
            "These morning headaches are basically your body’s way of coming down from an extreme amount of pressure overnight, he added. Tooth-grinding headaches generally occur around the temples and back toward the ears.",
            "Jaw pain",
            "Similarly to waking up with a headache, you may wake up with pain around your mouth muscles or notice fatigue in your jaw muscles, Cuffey-Terry said. This pain can last anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, but will likely be at its worst when you wake up in the morning.",
            "Jaw pain is not something you should be waking up with automatically, so if you notice this sensation, get in touch with your dentist.",
            "Tooth pain",
            "It may seem obvious, but if you have tooth pain or tooth soreness in the morning, you may be dealing with bruxism.",
            "Dr. Marjan Moghadam, a clinical associate professor at New York University’s College of Dentistry, noted that toothaches are a clear sign of teeth grinding at night. And, they’re reason enough to call your dentist. (And even beyond morning tooth pain, toothaches at any time of day should be reported.)",
            "Wear and tear on your teeth",
            "According to Moghadam, “the act of grinding can cause tooth wear that over time can lead to destruction of the tooth structure itself, as well as the bone that supports the tooth in the jawbone.”",
            "Specifically, if you’re looking in your mouth and notice that your tooth crown (which is the visible part of the tooth) is wearing down, you may be grinding your teeth at night, Cuffey-Terry added. In this instance, you may notice a chip in your tooth or discoloration in the form of white streaks.",
            "You may also notice a shift in your teeth, Moghadam added. If you have a tooth that appears to be pushed forward or backward out of nowhere, you may be grinding your teeth while you sleep.",
            "Sensitivity to hot and cold foods",
            "That wear and tear on your teeth impacts how you eat, too. According to Coombs, it is also common to experience sensitivity to hot and cold foods and drinks if you are a chronic grinder.",
            "“This has to do with the fact that, if you’re a prolonged grinder, you’ll start to see small fracture lines throughout the teeth,” he said. Those small fracture lines are “almost direct access to the nerve of the tooth.”",
            "If that glass of ice cold water has a clear path to your tooth’s nerve, you better believe you’ll feel some sensitivity as soon as you take a sip.",
            "Daytime sleepiness",
            "Someone who constantly grinds their teeth may not realize it, but they are likely waking themselves up every couple of hours throughout the night, Coombs said.",
            "This could be from discomfort or pain, or just the fact that a constantly moving mouth means a disruptive night of rest. As a result, you may be more likely to deal with sleepiness during the day.",
            "Teeth grinding is more common now than it was pre-pandemic",
            "You’re probably very aware that living through a pandemic has been stressful. So have things like inflation and political unrest, to name a few.",
            "And stress manifests itself in more ways than you’d think, including teeth grinding.",
            "The National Institutes of Health “did research in 2020 [that discovered] the linkage between stress and bruxism,” Coombs said. “What they found is 95% of people that are under an immense amount of stress show signs of bruxism.”",
            "And who isn’t at least a little bit stressed right now?",
            "Coombs added that the American Dental Association found a 70% increase in bruxism in a March 2021 poll, which cited the pandemic as the reason behind the increase in this stress response. If teeth grinding was something you never dealt with before, you’re not alone if you all of a sudden notice some teeth-grinding red flags.",
            "If you suspect you’re grinding your teeth, see your dentist",
            "If you think you’re grinding your teeth at night, you should seek professional help from your dentist, Moghadam said.",
            "“The dentist can examine and evaluate the signs and symptoms in order to rule out any other issue — such as dental infection or other habits that could be contributing.”",
            "They’ll also be able to make recommendations for the best next steps and treatments, which can include mouth guards, muscle relaxers or even stress management."

            "NASA rescheduled the launch of its Artemis I mission around the moon to Saturday after the space agency was forced to scrub the first attempt due to an issue with one of the spacecraft’s engines.",
            "The main problem Monday came after engineers couldn’t get one of the rocket’s four engines to the proper temperature needed to start them at liftoff. NASA said the Artemis team tried to quickly fix the issue before the scheduled departure time, but weren’t able to do so before a two-hour launch window closed.",
            "Mike Sarafin, the Artemis mission manager, said the team had found a path forward, including changing the engines’ loading procedure and starting the engine chill down earlier.",
            "The mission is the first in a series of launches that could ultimately see astronauts headed toward the moon for the first time in half a century and a major revitalization of NASA’s space exploration efforts.",
            "The next launch window opens at 2:17 p.m. ET Saturday for two hours, weather permitting. An additional window would open on Monday, NASA said.",
            "If the mission isn’t able to launch, it could potentially be pushed back by more than a month.",
            "The decision Monday was a disappointment for thousands of rocket-watchers who drove to Florida’s Kennedy Space Center, including Vice President Kamala Harris. But NASA said it wouldn’t fire up the rocket until doing so was safe, despite years of delays that have beleaguered the $40 billion project.",
            "Sarafin told reporters Monday engineers would be sifting through data from the first attempt to make sure everything was in order.",
            "“We’re going to play all nine innings here,” Sarafin said during a press briefing on Monday night. “We’re not ready to give up yet.”",
            "“We are going to give the team time to rest, first of all, and then come back fresh tomorrow and reassess what we learned today and then develop a series of options,” he added. “It’s too early to say what the options are.”",
            "Bill Nelson, NASA’s administrator, said the rocket was “brand new,” adding it wouldn’t “fly until it’s ready.”",
            "“I think it’s just illustrative that this is a very complicated machine, a very complicated system, and all those things have to work,” Nelson said during the press conference Monday.",
            "The Artemis mission will test NASA’s Space Launch System, a powerful rocket, that will propel the Orion spacecraft beyond the moon. The mission will be unmanned (holding three humanoid dummies), but the Orion craft will eventually be able to hold astronauts and begin a new era of space exploration. Humans haven’t stepped foot on the moon since the last Apollo mission in 1972, and NASA has pledged future efforts would see the first woman and the first person of color step foot on the lunar surface.",
            "When it does eventually leave, Artemis I will orbit the Earth before being propelled towards the moon. The spacecraft will fly within 60 miles of the moon’s surface as NASA monitors its systems, then go on into deep retrograde orbit for just under a week.",
            "The full mission will last four to six weeks before the Orion spacecraft reenters the Earth’s atmosphere, traveling some 25,000 mph and producing temperatures approaching 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit.",
            "“After about four to six weeks and a total distance traveled exceeding 1.3 million miles, the mission will end with a test of Orion’s capability to return safely to the Earth,” NASA says of the mission.",
            "The Artemis I launch, if it moves forward, will cap an invigorating summer for the country’s space agency. The heralded James Webb Space Telescope has been transmitting magical images from deep space since July, stunning cosmologists and astronomers and ushering in a new era of stargazing."

            "Secret Service Assistant Director Tony Ornato, who was at the center of bombshell testimony about former President Donald Trump’s alleged outbursts during the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, has stepped down from the federal agency.",
            "Ornato, who at one point also served as a White House political adviser to Trump, retired Monday “in good standing after 25 years of devoted service,” Kevin Helgert, a special agent at the Secret Service, confirmed in a statement to HuffPost.",
            "In a message to CNN, Ornato said he is leaving the agency to pursue a career in the private sector.",
            "“I long-planned to retire and have been planning this transition for more than a year,” he told the network.",
            "He did not provide any details about his next move but did say that he is not taking up a role with Trump or any of Trump’s businesses.",
            "Ornato’s departure follows Cassidy Hutchinson testifying in June that he personally told the former White House aide about witnessing Trump lunge at a Secret Service agent who refused the president’s request to drive him to the Capitol during the 2021 insurrection.",
            "“The president said something to the effect of, I’m the f-ing president, take me up to the Capitol now. To which [Secret Service agent Bobby Engel] responded, ‘Sir, we have to go back to the West Wing,’” Hutchinson recalled Ornato telling her at the time.",
            "“The president reached up toward the front of the vehicle to grab at the steering wheel. Mr. Engel grabbed his arm and said, ‘Sir, you need to take your hand off the steering wheel, we’re going back to the West Wing. We’re not going to the Capitol,’” Hutchinson continued. “Mr. Trump then used his free hand to lunge towards Bobby Engel and when Ornato had recounted the story to me, he had motioned towards his clavicles.”Hutchinson’s testimony came amid a yearslong investigation by a House select committee into the attack on the Capitol and efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election.Ornato, a longtime Secret Service agent, took a break from his work with the law enforcement body in 2019 to serve as deputy chief of staff for operations at the White House. In this role, which he held for approximately a year, he helped organize Trump’s political rallies and an infamous photo-op in which the then-president held a Bible outside the White House.This switch from serving as a protective agent to politics was unprecedented at the time. His eventual return to the Secret Service in late 2020 to oversee training would raise questions about agents’ ability to loyally protect then-incoming President Joe Biden due to any political alignments with Trump."

            "After Alia Macrina Heise gave birth to her third child in 2007, she began experiencing what she described at the time as “postpartum depression that comes and goes.”",
            "As a lactation consultant and mother of three, she knew that’s not how postpartum depression works, but she didn’t have any other language then for what she was feeling.",
            "“It was such a sudden drop in mood. And then everything was fine again,” Heise told HuffPost. For her, the drop in mood typically lasted for about two minutes.",
            "While doing some internet research, she stumbled upon a post in the postpartum depression section of a parenting forum. Titled “Only When Nursing,” it described what she had been dealing with to a T. For the first time, Heise made the connection between the emotions she was feeling and the act of breastfeeding. Because she experienced a lot of spontaneous letdowns — when milk is released from the breast when not nursing or pumping — she hadn’t tied the two things together before.",
            "Heise replied to the post describing what she felt in these moments:",
            "It’s a sickening feeling in the pit of my stomach. There is a strong aversion to food. I don’t feel sad, but I feel “icky and yucky.” It is a feeling I seem to have associated with strong feelings of worry and guilt in the past, because when I first started experiencing the sensation I kept searching for what I was feeling guilty or worried about. It turns out that there was nothing. It was just that same sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach that makes me lose my appetite that I had experienced in the past for these other reasons.",
            "Heise was determined to learn more about this underdiscussed phenomenon, which only seemed to be whispered about in online forums, and to give it a name. She connected with renowned lactation expert Diane Wiessinger, one of the co-authors of the eighth revised edition of “The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding.”",
            "Together, they coined the term “dysphoric milk-ejection reflex” — or D-MER — to describe this phenomenon, one characterized by an abrupt emotional drop that occurs right before letdown and lasts for just a few minutes. It can happen during breastfeeding, while pumping or alongside a spontaneous letdown.",
            "A 2021 review of existing research about D-MER called it “a common, yet not a commonly researched, condition.” One study looking at the condition’s epidemiology put the prevalence at 9.1% of breastfeeding women.",
            "Much of the data we have about D-MER is anecdotal in nature. Awareness of the condition is still low but is slowly increasing. It’s now beginning to emerge as a recognized phenomenon.",
            "D-MER Is A Physiological Condition — Not A Psychological One",
            "With postpartum depression, the feelings of sadness, hopelessness and worthlessness are persistent over a period of time. With D-MER, however, the negative sensations are fleeting — they dissipate as quickly as they came on.",
            "But how exactly those sensations are experienced, interpreted or felt varies from mother to mother. According to Heise, D-MER exists on three different emotional spectrums: despondency, anxiety and agitation. The intensity of emotion can range from mild to severe.",
            "Mild D-MER on the despondency spectrum — the most commonly reported type — involves feelings of homesickness, wistfulness or just feeling down. On the more severe end, it could include feelings of self-loathing or even suicidal ideation.",
            "On the anxiety spectrum, feelings can range from mild irritation to full-on panic.",
            "The least common spectrum is agitation; on the mild end, that might feel like restlessness and, when severe, could include feelings of rage.",
            "Because research on the condition is limited, it’s not yet well understood. But it is believed to be physiological in nature, rather than psychological, because it’s tied to the milk-ejection reflex, an automatic bodily process. You can compare it to tapping that spot under your kneecap and watching your leg kick out involuntarily.",
            "“D-MER follows the same pattern as any other reflex,” reads D-MER.org, a website Heise created about the condition. “You can tell yourself your knee isn’t going to jerk when you hit it, but it does, just as much the hundredth time as it does the first, and it stops as soon as the stimulus stops. The D-MER reflex involves emotion rather than motion because a hormone shift is triggered instead of having a muscle nerve triggered.”",
            "One theory is that people with D-MER experience an abrupt drop in the hormone dopamine accompanying letdown, which leads to feelings of dysphoria.",
            "Finding Out You’re Not Alone Can Be ‘Extremely Liberating’",
            "Dr. Aisha Rush is an OB-GYN in New York City and the mother of eight children. In retrospect, she says she experienced D-MER with all of her children, but she didn’t learn about the condition until after her last child was born.",
            "For Rush, the flood of negative feelings typically last several minutes into each breastfeeding or pumping session.",
            "“If I was enjoying what I was eating before, once I start pumping or nursing, I don’t even enjoy it,” she told HuffPost. “It almost feels like I just don’t want to eat anymore. Anything I enjoyed, it would almost be like you dread it. It’s almost like you just get depressed instantly.”",
            "Eventually, the overwhelming emotions of D-MER began to affect her marriage, too, causing frequent arguments with her husband. In those moments of dysphoria, even the thought of her husband touching her “made [her] want to be sick.”",
            "Rush also believes her D-MER symptoms were responsible for sending her into a “full-blown postpartum depression” after the births of two of her children, she said.",
            "It wasn’t until her eighth child was born that Rush finally thought to Google “Why do I feel depressed when I breastfeed?” Articles about D-MER came up in her search results.",
            "“I couldn’t believe it: There was such a significant relief,” Rush said. “My heart smiled because I realized I wasn’t crazy. And I realized that all of these years what I’d been experiencing is actually a real thing. It was extremely liberating.”",
            "How To Cope With D-MER",
            "Currently, there is no known cure for D-MER, other than time. Symptoms usually begin within the first several weeks of breastfeeding and subside gradually over time. For some people, D-MER takes a few months to resolve; for others, it may take longer. Some people may decide to wean earlier than they originally planned to because D-MER symptoms are too severe or overwhelming.",
            "However, there are things that can make the condition more manageable. One crucial tool is awareness of and education about D-MER. Too often, people are suffering in silence. They know they’re struggling with something, but they can’t quite pinpoint why or with what, so they don’t speak up.",
            "“Once mothers have the information, they know they’re not alone, they know they’re not crazy. Because that’s generally what we hear first and foremost when a mother finds the information: ‘I thought I was crazy.’ That takes the edge off a lot,” Heise said.",
            "Rush also encourages people to open up about what they’re dealing with. That might mean connecting with a lactation expert from a breastfeeding organization, like La Leche League, who has specific knowledge of the condition. Online support groups can also provide a good outlet for conversations. You can also have conversations with trusted family and friends or talk to a therapist or doctor who specializes in maternal health.",
            "“The one thing women need to do is talk about it,” Rush said. “Because when you’re going through this and you don’t know what you’re experiencing, you feel like a prisoner in your own body, you feel like a prisoner in your own mind, and you feel like a prisoner to this process. It’s almost as if you have this ball and chain you’re carrying around with you.”",
            "To cope, Rush also does skin-to-skin time with her son while she’s pumping, as it provides a good distraction from what’s happening in her mind and allows her to focus on the baby. Other light distractions like watching a TV show or listening to music may provide some relief.",
            "Lifestyle changes such as getting exercise, prioritizing sleep and staying hydrated may also help ease symptoms, according to D-Mer.org. If symptoms are severe, prescription medication may be an option. Talk to your health care provider to determine the best course of action for you."

            "The MTV VMAs has delivered on its grand tradition of serving the thirsty masses some juicy drama.",
            "Over the years, new couples have let loose at the award show — think Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson being extra during their red carpet debut in 2018 and the awkward onstage kiss newlyweds Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Pressley shared in 1994. So it was only right for a new couple to make waves in 2022.",
            "Rapper Yung Gravy and Sheri Nicole Easterling, who is the mother of TikTok star Addison Rae, made their romance public at the award show Sunday night.",
            "During a pre-show interview with MTV, Easterling and the “Betty” rapper opened up about how the seemingly unlikely pair came to meet.",
            "“We met online. Yeah. We connected right away. I’m from the furthest north it gets, she’s from the furthest south it gets,” Yung Gravy, 26, said of Easterling, 42, after his pre-show performance as the two kissed on the carpet.",
            "“I’m into MILFs and she’s kind of the queen of MILFs, so I figured it was just a perfect match,” he added.",
            "MILF — shorthand for “mom I’d like to fuck” — was popularized after it was used in the 1999 film “American Pie.” However, many see it the term as outdated and misogynistic.",
            "Yung Gravy later elaborated on the word he chose to describe his new love.",
            "“They’re more experienced. They are an under-serviced community. I’d like to say and they deserve more attention, so I thought that’d be the one,” he told Entertainment Tonight. “And I’ve noticed that people really have started giving MILFs more attention since my music dropped.”",
            "The rapper has a habit of fetishizing older women in his music — he has a song called “Martha Stewart,” which is about the television personality and the rapper’s love for “cougars.”",
            "Meanwhile, Easterling posted a selfie of her, a stylist and Yung Gravy to her Instagram Stories from the event — showing that she was seemingly pleased by how her red carpet debut went down at the VMAs.",
            "Her estranged husband, Monty Lopez, however, had a different spin on his ex’s new romance.",
            "“Thank you @younggravy for taking the leftovers,” Lopez said in an Instagram Story in response to Easterling’s debut.",
            "Easterling — who shares daughter Addison Rae, 21, and sons Enzo, 14, and Lucas, 8, with her estranged husband — has been separated from Lopez for about a year, a source told People. The former couple also seem to have had an on-and-off relationship — they broke up when their daughter Addison Rae was a kid and then remarried in 2017.",
            "In July, rumors that Lopez and Easterling were on the rocks began circulating when influencer Renée Ash, 25, told Page Six she had a five-month relationship with Lopez, 46. Ash said Lopez “misled” her by telling her that his marriage to Easterling was over."

            "Sixteen years ago, amid a pitched battle to become Florida’s governor, Charlie Crist unleashed a scathing TV ad highlighting the absenteeism of his opponent, then-Rep. Jim Davis (D), showing an empty office chair rolling past Washington landmarks.",
            "After the chair passes the Capitol, the Jefferson Memorial and the Washington Monument, the narrator asks, “If he doesn’t show up for work now, why should we elect him governor?” Crist, then a Republican, won by 7 percentage points.",
            "Almost two decades later, Crist, now a Democrat, has perfected something Davis could only dream about: being in two places at once, at least on paper.",
            "That’s because of the U.S. House’s continued use of proxy voting, in which lawmakers allow other lawmakers to cast their vote while they’re absent. Crist used proxy voting to vote for the Inflation Reduction Act in mid-August, even as he had a full schedule of get-out-the-vote events set for the next day in Florida.",
            "With the heart of the midterm campaign season looming in September, Crist’s case shows a tempting use of proxy voting for something other than public health: to allow lawmakers to skip being in the House in favor of being on the campaign trail.",
            "And with proxies becoming more widely used since 2020, this fall could see a rise in absentee voting as lawmakers weigh the practical value of being in the House chamber — where votes are usually seen as predetermined — versus pressing the flesh back home.",
            "‘Physically Unable To Attend’",
            "Technically, House members are only supposed to use proxy voting when they are “physically unable to attend proceedings in the House Chamber due to the ongoing public health emergency.” It’s part of a rules change that was passed in May 2020 to allow members to cast votes even if they could not be present due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But there is no procedure to verify a member’s reason for using it and no limits on how often proxy voting can be used.",
            "Crist was by no means alone in voting by proxy on the climate and tax bill. House records indicate some 158 members, or more than a third of the entire House, declared they were unable to attend due to COVID-19 on that Friday in August.",
            "And while Crist may be a prolific user of proxy voting, he is by no means alone or even the biggest user on the campaign trail. That title may belong to Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), who is running for the U.S. Senate and had given his proxy 42 times in the current Congress, as of late August, compared with Crist’s 23.",
            "Crist’s office did not return a request for comment about his use of proxy voting while Ryan said “remote voting” should be a permanent option. “The year is 2022, we can walk and chew gum at the same time, and members of Congress should be able to use the technology at our disposal to do our jobs while also meeting face-to-face with the people we serve, taking care of kids, and more,” he said.",
            "The job of a member of Congress pays $174,000 a year, usually requires in-person attendance at the Capitol only three to four days a week, and comes with plenty of formal and informal perks. Perhaps that’s why proxy voting hasn’t been embraced by some members, including some of the old guard.",
            "“The body needs to be in the building,” Rep. Frank Lucas, a 15-term Oklahoma Republican told HuffPost before lawmakers left for their August break.",
            "“We need to be together. We need to be looking at each other. We need to be talking to each other. And if you’re not physically able to do that for a two-year period, then maybe you should assess whether you’re a member or not,” he said.",
            "Not Just Democrats",
            "Republicans have argued House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has kept extending the temporary allowance of proxy voting to make it easier for Democrats to win close legislative votes with their narrow three-member majority, and House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) has vowed to end the practice if Republicans take control after November’s midterms.",
            "“If you think about it, that’s the story of this Democrat majority. They will destroy our economy and mortgage your future, but can’t be personally bothered to show up to make the trip to D.C. to do their jobs. What a disgrace,” McCarthy said during the Inflation Reduction Act debate.",
            "But while Democrats have been much more open to using proxy voting, many Republicans have lost their initial wariness and begun to embrace it. One Republican, Rep. Brad Wenstrup (Ohio), was spotted at a Washington area airport only hours after attending a press conference at the Capitol but before the Inflation Reduction Act vote, in which he voted by proxy.",
            "According to Brookings Institute researchers, 144 of the then-213 House GOP members had used proxy voting at least once in the current Congress through December of 2021, a number that’s likely grown since. On average, Republicans voted by proxy 29 times during that period, compared with 54 times for Democrats.",
            "Rep. Steny Hoyer (Md.), the second-ranking House Democrat, told reporters in July he sees a need for proxy voting, even as he thinks its use may need to be tightened to prevent abuse.",
            "“I’m not one of those that’s lathered up about proxy voting,” he said. “The pandemic’s not over.”",
            "“There’s no doubt, however, that people are using it for convenience, not health. On both sides of the aisle,” Hoyer said. “We need to deal with it so we have a policy that is a rational one but also one that lets people be heard when they’re sick or something, or when their family members are sick.”",
            "As a former chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, Rep. Pete Sessions (Texas) has little doubt proxies will be used more this fall so members can keep campaigning. On the bright side, the House is already out of session until the second full week of September and is scheduled to be out for all of October.",
            "“So it will only be in September that it will get bad, before the election,” he told HuffPost.",
            "Human Nature",
            "Lucas, the Oklahoma Republican, said there are legitimate reasons to use proxy voting, and noted he used it himself after his wife had hip replacement surgery.",
            "But he warned about human nature.",
            "“Members of Congress are no different than normal people. Given an inch, most people will take a foot,” he said."

            "“If there’s a prosecution of Donald Trump for mishandling classified information, after the [Hillary] Clinton debacle … there’ll be riots in the streets,” Graham said on Fox News’ “Sunday Night in America,” hosted by former South Carolina congressman Trey Gowdy (R).",

            "In Trump’s case, after officials tried for several months to retrieve U.S. documents from him, FBI agents this month confiscated several boxes of material stashed at Mar-a-Lago, including classified documents and even highly sensitive top-secret information.",
            "Trump was captured in a recorded phone call telling Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find” just enough votes for him after the 2020 presidential election to change his loss into a victory. “Fellas, I need 11,000 votes. Give me a break,” Trump pleaded.",
            "Graham is currently battling a subpoena to appear before the grand jury in that probe. The probe, launched by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, has been expanded to look into the alleged involvement of a Trump ally in the suspected breach of voting equipment in the state.",
            "Graham insisted to Gowdy that Trump is treated with a “double standard.”",
            "“Most Republicans, including me, believe when it comes to Trump, there is no law. It’s all about getting him,” Graham told Gowdy.",
            "Critics on Twitter were outraged by yet another threat of violence during investigations into suspected crimes."

            "ISLAMABAD (AP) — Deaths from widespread flooding in Pakistan topped 1,000 since mid-June, officials said Sunday, as the country’s climate minister called the deadly monsoon season “a serious climate catastrophe.”",
            "Flash flooding from the heavy rains has washed away villages and crops as soldiers and rescue workers evacuated stranded residents to the safety of relief camps and provided food to thousands of displaced Pakistanis.",
            "Pakistan's National Disaster Management Authority reported the death toll since the monsoon season began earlier than normal this year — in mid- June — reached 1,033 people after new fatalities were reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and southern Sindh provinces.",
            "Sherry Rehman, a Pakistani senator and the country's top climate official, said in a video posted on Twitter that Pakistan is experiencing a “serious climate catastrophe, one of the hardest in the decade.”",
            "“We are at the moment at the ground zero of the front line of extreme weather events, in an unrelenting cascade of heatwaves, forest fires, flash floods, multiple glacial lake outbursts, flood events and now the monster monsoon of the decade is wreaking non-stop havoc throughout the country,\" she said. The on-camera statement was retweeted by the country’s ambassador to the European Union.",
            "Flooding from the Swat River overnight affected northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where tens of thousands of people — especially in the Charsadda and Nowshehra districts — have been evacuated from their homes to relief camps set up in government buildings. Many have also taken shelter on roadsides, said Kamran Bangash, a spokesperson for the provincial government.",
            "Bangash said some 180,000 people have been evacuated from Charsadda and 150,000 from Nowshehra district villages.",
            "Khaista Rehman, 55, no relation to the climate minister, took shelter with his wife and three children on the side of the Islamabad-Peshawar highway after his home in Charsadda was submerged overnight.",
            "“Thank God we are safe now on this road quite high from the flooded area,\" he said. \"Our crops are gone and our home is destroyed but I am grateful to Allah that we are alive and I will restart life with my sons.”",
            "The unprecedented monsoon season has affected all four of the country's provinces. Nearly 300,000 homes have been destroyed, numerous roads rendered impassable and electricity outages have been widespread, affecting millions of people.",
            "Pope Francis on Sunday said he wanted to assure his “closeness to the populations of Pakistan struck by flooding of disastrous proportions.’’ Speaking during a pilgrimage to the Italian town of L’Aquila, which was hit by a deadly earthquake in 2009, Francis said he was praying “for the many victims, for the injured and the evacuated, and so that international solidarity will be prompt and generous.”",
            "Rehman told Turkish news outlet TRT World that by the time the rains recede, \"we could well have one fourth or one third of Pakistan under water.”",
            "“This is something that is a global crisis and of course we will need better planning and sustainable development on the ground. ... We’ll need to have climate resilient crops as well as structures,” she said.",
            "In May, Rehman told BBC Newshour that both the country’s north and south were witnessing extreme weather events because of rising temperatures. “So in north actually just now we are ... experiencing what is known as glacial lake outburst floods which we have many of because Pakistan is home to the highest number of glaciers outside the polar region.\"",
            "The government has deployed soldiers to help civilian authorities in rescue and relief operations across the country. The Pakistani army also said in a statement it airlifted a 22 tourists trapped in a valley in the country's north to safety.",
            "Prime Minister Shabaz Sharif visited flooding victims in city of Jafferabad in Baluchistan. He vowed the government would provide housing to all those who lost their homes.",

            "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — A man hired last spring to carry out what appeared to be an active shooting at an Omaha charity — complete with actors smeared with fake blood — has been criminally charged with terrorism counts.",
            "John Channels, of Omaha, was arrested and charged Tuesday with five counts of making terroristic threats and one weapons count. The Omaha World-Herald first reported the arrest.",
            "The incident happened May 19, when Channels, 27, showed up at Omaha Catholic Charities firing blanks from a semiautomatic handgun and staging “victims” who appeared to have been wounded or killed, police said. The charity hired him to test its workers’ preparedness for such an attack.",
            "The incident caused panic among the charity’s employees because they had not been informed it was a drill. Police said the charity paid Channels $2,500 to carry out the mock shooting and went along with his request not to inform employees beforehand.",
            "One employee told the World-Herald that in her panic at hearing the gunfire, she fled the building and leapt from a retaining wall intending to land and hide in a dumpster several feet below. But she missed and landed on the ground, where she curled up in pain before she ran several blocks to a restaurant.",
            "Omaha Catholic Charities’ executive director, Denise Bartels said in a statement Wednesday afternoon that the organization hired Channels “based upon recommendations from respected sources, and he clearly misrepresented himself and his qualifications.”",
            "Bartels said Channels didn’t follow agreed upon procedures and didn’t communicate properly with police. “We deeply regret following his recommendations and selecting him for the training,” Bartels said, adding that staff members continue to be offered mental health support.",
            "Channels was arrested and jailed Tuesday and did not have an attorney representing him on the terror charges as of Wednesday. At the time of his arrest, he was already out on bond for charges in a separate case accusing him of sexually assaulting a minor.",
            "According to a police arrest affidavit, Channels told those at Catholic Charities who hired him that he had conducted other active shooter drills and that law enforcement officers would be present during the drill. But police say not only were officers not present for the drill, police were not even told of it ahead of time, leading officers to respond to panicked employees’ calls with guns drawn.",
            "Douglas County prosecutor Don Kleine said the mock drill could have had dire consequences — such as a panicked employee suffering a heart attack or Channels himself being shot by someone else or an officer.",
            "“Somebody could have gotten killed,” Kleine told the World-Herald. “Just think of the potential things that could have happened with this — it’s frightful.”"

            "Fierce Donald Trump ally Kash Patel is claiming his life is now in danger because his name appears in the heavily redacted affidavit released Friday supporting the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago earlier this month.",
            "“Brown Lives Matter,” a clearly furious Patel said in a statement late Friday.",
            "In a message posted on Truth Social, Patel called it a “vicious attack from DOJ/FBI who intentionally jeopardized my safety by un-redacting my name in the most reviewed search warrant in the history of the United States.”",
            "The “DOJ is on the line for my security with their dangerous actions,” Patel added. “These gangsters are on notice.”",
            "But Patel, a former top Pentagon staffer, had already placed himself very publicly in the middle of the documents issue. He quickly defended the former president after FBI agents seized several boxes of documents at Mar-a-Lago, including classified and even top-secret information.",
            "Patel and the former president have insisted in interviews that Trump had a “standing order” that documents removed from the White House were “declassified.”",
            "Patel claimed in an interview with Breitbart that he was “there with Trump when he said, ‘We are declassifying this information.’”",
            "But no written evidence has been presented to support that. In addition, experts say Trump had to follow a process to declassify documents, and share his decision so other officials would know. There doesn’t appear to be any evidence of that.",
            "Other White House officials have said they never heard of such an order.",
            "Patel appears in a footnote in the affidavit referring to his claim to Breitbart.",
            "The footnote quotes the Breitbart article that Patel “characterized as ‘misleading’” that “classified material is among records that POTUS provided” to the National Archives from Mar-a-Lago.",
            "The claim of widespread declassification was not mentioned in Trump’s latest motion to have a “special master” review the seized documents to determine if any might have been somehow protected by executive privilege.",
            "A letter from Trump lawyer Evan Corcoran included in the affidavit suggests Trump had absolute declassification authority, but it does not state that Trump actually declassified any of the documents.",
            "Former Justice Department prosecutor Andrew Weissmann said Friday on MSNBC that while Patel may not be in added danger from death since the release of the affidavit, the document does indicate he could be at legal risk (see the video below).",
            "He is “clearly in the crosshairs,” said Weissmann, noting that the affidavit apparently does not refer to any “declassified” documents.",
            "Patel “really needs to be getting a lawyer,” said Weissmann."

            "The startling case underscores the security challenges of Donald Trump’s resort even as the former president stashed top-secret U.S. government files there.",
            "Inna Yashchyshyn, who sported a pricey Rolex watch and drove a $170,000 Mercedes, reportedly claimed to members of the private club that she was an heiress of the wealthy European Rothschild banking family and had ties to top real estate developers.",
            "The woman — who went by the name Anna de Rothschild and was actually the daughter of an Illinois truck driver — mingled last year with Trump, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and other close associates of the men during “multiple” trips and at various Mar-a-Lago functions, reported the Post-Gazette, which uncovered the story with the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project.",
            "“It was the near-perfect ruse and she played the part,” John LeFevre, a former investment banker who met her with other guests around a club pool, told the newspaper.",
            "Yashchyshyn, 33, demonstrated “the ease with which someone with a fake identity and shadowy background” could slip through security at Trump’s club, “one of America’s power centers and the epicenter of Republican Party politics,” noted the Post-Gazette.",
            "The FBI has obtained several records linked to Yashchyshyn as part of its investigation, including copies of two fake passports from the U.S. and Canada, the Post-Gazette reported. Investigators reportedly also have a Florida driver’s license belonging to “Anna de Rothschild” with the address of a $13 million Miami Beach mansion where Yashchyshyn has never lived.",
            "No other details of the investigation were available, and Yashchyshyn could not be reached for comment.",
            "It wasn’t until March of this year that members of Trump’s entourage realized Yashchyshyn was an imposter, the Post-Gazette and OCCRP reported.",
            "In 2019, a Chinese woman with two different passports and who was loaded down with electronic equipment managed to slip past a Secret Service agent by saying she was headed to the Mar-a-Lago pool.",

            "The crotch shot wasn’t all Donald Jr. came up with, but it was the most “graphic.” Mostly he mocked all the redactions in the affidavit, which the Justice Department had explained were necessary to protect witnesses, the names of FBI agents and other details of the investigation of his father.",
            "Threats against the FBI have skyrocketed in the wake of vicious attacks against the bureau by Donald Trump, federal authorities reported earlier this month in a joint intelligence bulletin released by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security.",

            "The affidavit, although heavily blacked out, detailed repeated requests by federal officials for boxes of documents that the former president had stashed at his Mar-a-Lago estate when he left the White House. It showed that highly classified information was haphazardly stored at the private country club that includes his residence. The information contradicted Trump’s claim that officials only had to ask and they would have been given the material.",
            "The National Archives first reached out about retrieving records from Mar-a-Lago in May 2021, according to the affidavit. Trump’s aides responded later that year that they had 12 boxes ready to be picked up, and the National Archives eventually left with 15 boxes in January.",
            "FBI agents searched Trump’s Florida estate on Aug. 8 and took away dozens of additional boxes, including 11 packets of classified documents. Among that set was a batch labeled with the highest classification markings, meant for review only in secure government facilities.Justice Department prosecutors filed the redacted affidavit at the federal courthouse in West Palm Beach, Florida, late Friday morning after Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart ruled on Thursday that he had accepted the redactions prosecutors had proposed. He described the redactions as “narrowly tailored to serve the government’s legitimate interest in the integrity of the ongoing investigation and are the least onerous alternative to sealing the entire affidavit.”"

            "MEXICO CITY (AP) — Six of the 43 college students “disappeared” in 2014 were allegedly kept alive in a warehouse for days then turned over to the local army commander who ordered them killed, the Mexican government official leading a Truth Commission said Friday.",
            "Interior Undersecretary Alejandro Encinas made the shocking revelation directly tying the military to one of Mexico’s worst human rights scandals, and it came with little fanfare as he made a lengthy defense of the commission’s report released a week earlier.",
            "Last week, despite declaring the abductions and disappearances a “state crime” and saying that the army watched it happen without intervening, Encinas made no mention of six students being turned over to Col. José Rodríguez Pérez.",
            "On Friday, Encinas said authorities were closely monitoring the students from the radical teachers’ college at Ayotzinapa from the time they left their campus through their abduction by local police in the town of Iguala that night. A soldier who had infiltrated the school was among the abducted students, and Encinas asserted the army did not follow its own protocols and try to rescue him.",
            "“There is also information corroborated with emergency 089 telephone calls where allegedly six of the 43 disappeared students were held during several days and alive in what they call the old warehouse and from there were turned over to the colonel,” Encinas said. “Allegedly the six students were alive for as many as four days after the events and were killed and disappeared on orders of the colonel, allegedly the then Col. José Rodríguez Pérez.”",
            "The defense department did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the allegations Friday.",
            "The role of the army in the students’ disappearance has long been a source of tension between the families and the government. From the beginning, there were questions about the military’s knowledge of what happened and its possible involvement. The students’ parents demanded for years that they be allowed to search the army base in Iguala. It was not until 2019 that they were given access along with Encinas and the Truth Commission.",
            "The commission report says the army registered an anonymous emergency call on Sept. 30, 2014, four days after the students’ abduction. The caller reportedly said the students were being held in a large concrete warehouse in a location described as “Pueblo Viejo.” The caller proceeded to describe the location.",
            "That entry was followed by several pages of redacted material, but that section of the report concluded with the following: “As can be seen, obvious collusion existed between agents of the Mexican state with the criminal group Guerreros Unidos that tolerated, allowed and participated in events of violence and disappearance of the students, as well as the government’s attempt to hide the truth about the events.”",
            "Later, in a summary of how the commission’s report differed from the original investigation’s conclusions, there is mention of a colonel.",
            "“On Sept. 30 ‘the colonel’ mentions that they will take care of cleaning everything up and that they had already taken charge of the six students who had remained alive,” the report said.",
            "In a witness statement provided to federal investigators in December 2014, Capt. José Martínez Crespo, who was stationed at the base in Iguala, said the base commander for the 27th Infantry Battalion at the time was Col. José Rodriguez Pérez.",
            "Through a driving rain later Friday, the families of the 43 missing students marched in Mexico City with a couple hundred other people as they have on the 26th of every month for years.",
            "Parents carried posters of their children’s faces and rows of current students from the teachers’ college marched, shouted calls for justice and counted off to 43. Their signs proclaimed that the fight for justice continued and asserted: “It was the State.”",
            "Clemente Rodríguez marched for his son Christian Alfonso Rodríguez Telumbre, who was a second student identified by a tiny burned bone fragment.",
            "Rodríguez said the families had been told last week before the report was released about the coronel and the six students.",
            "“It’s not by omission anymore. It’s that they participated,” he said of the military. “It was the state, the three levels of government participated.”",
            "He said the families had not been told that any of the arrest orders announced last week for members of armed forces had been carried out yet.",
            "On Sept. 26, 2014, local police took the students off buses they had commandeered in Iguala. The motive for the police action remains unclear eight years later. Their bodies have never been found, though fragments of burned bone have been matched to three of the students.",
            "Last week, federal agents arrested former Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam, who oversaw the original investigation. On Wednesday, a judge ordered that he stand trial for forced disappearance, not reporting torture and official misconduct. Prosecutors allege Murillo Karam created a false narrative about what happened to the students to quickly appear to resolve the case.",
            "Authorities also said last week that arrest warrants were issued for 20 soldiers and officers, five local officials, 33 local police officers and 11 state police officers as well as 14 gang members. Neither the army nor prosecutors have said how many of those suspects are in custody.",
            "It was also not immediately clear if Rodríguez Pérez was among those sought.",
            "Rodríguez, the student’s father, said Murillo Karam’s arrest was a positive step.",
            "Murillo Karam “was the one who told us the soldiers couldn’t be touched,” Rodríguez said. “And now it’s being discovered that it was the state that participated.”",
            "In a joint statement, the families said the Truth Commission’s confirmation that it was a “state crime” was significant after elements suggesting that over the years.",
            "However, they said the report still did not satisfactorily answer their most important question.",
            "“Mothers and fathers need indubitable scientific evidence as to the fate of our children,” the statement said. “We can’t go home with preliminary signs that don’t fully clear up where they are and what happened to them.”",
            "President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has given Mexico’s military enormous responsibility. The armed forces are not only at the center of his security strategy, but they have taken over administration of the seaports and been given responsibility for building a new airport for the capital and a tourist train on the Yucatan Peninsula.",
            "The president has said often that the army and navy are the least corrupt institutions and have his confidence."

            "He singled out Teigen, calling her one of the “nasty trolls who would just say the most awful, horrible things about her.” Kushner said Ivanka “would always brush if off, but I would imagine it had to hurt.”",
            "The outspoken Teigen has frequently criticized Ivanka Trump and her father.",
            "In a panel discussion at a House Democratic Caucus retreat in 2019, she harshly criticized the former first daughter for her lack of empathy while her father pushed a policy to separate children from their immigrant parents at the southern border.",
            "It’s “painful to see” images and videos of heart-wrenching separations with sobbing children, Teigen said at the time, and “it’s a painful thing to see such a complete lack of empathy by people like Ivanka.” Teigen is currently expecting her third child with musician John Legend.",
            "During the height of the controversial border policy in early 2018, Ivanka Trump posed on social media hugging one of her own children. Donald Trump’s sister Maryanne Trump Barry called “that damn Ivanka” — a “mini Donald” —“oblivious” for putting this “picture of the ‘Madonna [Ivanka] and Child’ on Instagram when the big news of the day was how children are getting ripped away from their parents.”",

            "The sworn affidavit that prosecutors used to persuade a federal judge to let them search Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home earlier this month says that classified documents would likely be found there as well as “evidence of obstruction,” according to a redacted version released Friday.",
            "“There is probable cause to believe that additional documents that contain classified NDI or that are Presidential records subject to record retention requirements currently remain at the PREMISES. There is also probable cause to believe that evidence of obstruction will be found at the PREMISES,” the heavily redacted, 38-page affidavit reads.",
            "NDI refers to National Defense Information ― a category of documents considered highly sensitive.",
            "The Department of Justice’s proposed redactions, and reasons for those redactions, were also released.",
            "The affidavit, filed by an FBI agent from the Washington, D.C., office with training in “counterintelligence and espionage investigations,” says that the agency was brought in to investigate by the National Archives after officials there found that 15 boxes retrieved from Mar-a-Lago earlier this year included highly classified material.",
            "“Of most significant concern was that highly classified records were unfoldered, intermixed with other records, and otherwise unproperly [sic] identified,” the FBI agent wrote.",
            "The FBI did a preliminary review of the material in those boxes and found documents with classification markings in 14 out of the 15, the special agent wrote, describing the documents using a string of acronyms referring to classified material and “FPOTUS” for former President Trump:",
            "“A preliminary triage of the documents with classification markings revealed the following approximate numbers: 184 unique documents bearing classification markings, including 67 documents marked as CONFIDENTIAL, 92 documents marked as SECRET, and 25 documents marked as TOP SECRET. Further, the FBI agents observed markings reflecting the following compartments/dissemination controls: HCS, FISA, ORCON, NOFORN, and SI. Based on my training and experience, I know that documents classified at these levels typically contain NDI. Several of the documents also contained what appears to be FPOTUS’s handwritten notes.”",
            "The categories include HSC, which refers to “intelligence information derived from clandestine human sources,” and NOFORN, which means that material is not to be released to any foreign governments or nationals.",
            "The agent then quotes from a June 8 letter from the Department of Justice to Trump’s lawyers that said the classified material was not being securely controlled.",
            "“They have not been handled in an appropriate manner or stored in an appropriate location. Accordingly, we ask that the room at Mar-a-Lago where the documents had been stored be secured and that all of the boxes that were moved from the White House to Mar-a-Lago (along with any other items in that room) be preserved in that room in their current condition until further notice,” the letter read.",
            "Much of text of the affidavit is entirely blacked out to protect the names of investigators, witnesses and investigative techniques. The entirety of Pages 24 through 28 is just black lines, except for paragraph numbers and a subheading: “There is probable cause to believe that documents containing classified NDI and presidential records remain at the premises.”",
            "DOJ prosecutors filed the redacted affidavit at the federal courthouse in West Palm Beach, Florida, late Friday morning after Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart ruled on Thursday that he had accepted the redactions prosecutors proposed to the affidavit as “narrowly tailored to serve the government’s legitimate interest in the integrity of the ongoing investigation and are the least onerous alternative to sealing the entire affidavit.”",
            "An hour after the release of the affidavit, Trump posted another message on his social media network attacking the FBI, the Justice Department and the judge in the case.",
            "“Affidavit heavily redacted!!! Nothing mentioned on ‘Nuclear,’ a total public relations subterfuge by the FBI & DOJ, or our close working relationship regarding document turnover - WE GAVE THEM MUCH. Judge Bruce Reinhart should NEVER have allowed the Break-In of my home,” he wrote on Truth Social.",
            "The former president has publicly demanded the release of the unredacted affidavit but did not make that request in court.",
            "FBI agents searched Trump’s tennis and social club in Palm Beach on Aug. 8 and took away boxes of material, including 11 packets of classified documents. Among that set was a batch labeled with the highest classification markings, meant for review only in secure government facilities.",
            "Trump, who had already been attacking the FBI and prosecutors for investigating his actions on and leading up to the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection has ramped up criticism of law enforcement since then.",
            "His followers have responded by threatening FBI agents and the Department of Justice, and one Trump supporter was killed in a shootout with police after he tried to attack the FBI’s Cincinnati field office.",
            "In addition to the federal criminal investigations, a Georgia prosecutor is separately investigating Trump and his allies’ attempts to coerce state officials into falsely declaring him the winner in that state.",
            "Trump, despite losing the election by 7 million votes nationally and 306-232 in the Electoral College, became the first president in more than two centuries of elections to refuse to hand over power peacefully. His incitement of the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol — his last-ditch attempt to remain in office ― killed five, including one police officer, injured another 140 officers and led to four police suicides.",
            "Nevertheless, Trump remains the dominant figure in the Republican Party and is openly speaking about running for the presidency again in 2024.",
            "In statements on his personal social media platform, Trump has continued to lie about the election and the House Jan. 6 committee’s work, calling it a “hoax” similar to previous investigations into his 2016 campaign’s acceptance of Russian assistance and his attempted extortion of Ukraine into helping his 2020 campaign.",

            "BALTIMORE (AP) — On a hot, humid East Coast day this summer, a massive container ship pulled into the Port of Baltimore loaded with sheets of plywood, aluminum rods and radioactive material – all sourced from the fields, forests and factories of Russia.",
            "President Joe Biden promised to “inflict pain” and deal “a crushing blow” on Vladimir Putin through trade restrictions on commodities like vodka, diamonds and gasoline in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine six months ago. But hundreds of other types of unsanctioned goods worth billions of dollars, including those found on the ship bound for Baltimore from St. Petersburg, Russia, continue to flow into U.S. ports.",
            "The Associated Press found more than 3,600 shipments of wood, metals, rubber and other goods have arrived at U.S. ports from Russia since it began launching missiles and airstrikes into its neighbor in February. That’s a significant drop from the same period in 2021 when about 6,000 shipments arrived, but it still adds up to more than $1 billion worth of commerce a month.",
            "In reality, no one involved actually expected trade to drag to a halt after the invasion. Banning imports of certain items would likely do more harm to those sectors in the U.S. than in Russia.",
            "“When we impose sanctions, it could disrupt global trade. So our job is to think about which sanctions deliver the most impact while also allowing global trade to work,” Ambassador Jim O’Brien, who heads the State Department’s Office of Sanctions Coordination, told the AP.",
            "Experts say the global economy is so intertwined that sanctions must be limited in scope to avoid driving up prices in an already unstable market.",
            "Also, U.S. sanctions don’t exist in a vacuum; layers of European Union and U.K bans result in convoluted trade rules that can be confusing to buyers, sellers and policymakers.",
            "For example, the Biden administration and the EU released separate lists of Russian companies that cannot receive exports, but at least one of those companies — which supplies the Russian military with metal to make fighter jets currently dropping bombs in Ukraine –- is still selling millions of dollars of metal to American and European firms, AP found.",
            "While some U.S. importers are sourcing alternative materials elsewhere, others say they have no choice. In the case of wood imports, Russia’s dense birch forests create such hard, strong timber that most American wooden classroom furniture, and much home flooring, is made from it. Shipping containers of Russian items — groats, weightlifting shoes, crypto mining gear, even pillows — arrive at U.S. ports almost every day.",
            "A breakdown of imported goods from Russia shows some items are clearly legal and even encouraged by the Biden administration, like the more than 100 shipments of fertilizer that have arrived since the invasion. Now-banned products like Russian oil and gas continued to arrive in U.S. ports long after the announcement of sanctions due to “wind down” periods, allowing companies to complete existing contracts.",
            "In some cases, the origin of products shipped out of Russian ports can be difficult to discern. U.S. energy companies are continuing to import oil from Kazakhstan through Russian ports, even though that oil is sometimes mixed with Russian fuel. Trade experts warn that Russian suppliers are unreliable, and opaque corporate structures of most major Russian companies make it difficult to determine whether they have ties to the government.",
            "“It is a general rule: when you have sanctions, you’ll have all kinds of murky schemes and illicit trade,” said Russian economist Konstantin Sonin, who teaches at the University of Chicago. “Still, sanctions make sense because even though you cannot kill 100% of revenues, you can reduce them.”",
            "Many American companies are choosing to cut off Russian trade. Coors beer, for example, returned a shipment of hops to a state-owned Russian company in May as part of a commitment to suspend all business in the country, said Molson Coors Beverage Co. spokeswoman Jennifer Martinez.",
            "Russia and the U.S. were never major trading partners, and so sanctioning imports is only a very small slice of the retaliatory strategy. Restrictions on exports from the U.S. –- of technology in particular –- cause more damage to the Russian economy, and sanctioning the Russian Central Bank has frozen Russia’s access to roughly $600 billion in currency reserves held across the U.S. and Europe.",
            "Nonetheless, sanctions carry a symbolic weight beyond the financial harm they might inflict, particularly for American consumers horrified by the war.",
            "Here’s a look at some of the goods that have flowed between the two countries:",
            "METALS",
            "Russia is a key exporter of metals like aluminum, steel and titanium; cutting off that trade could dramatically drive up prices for Americans already grappling with inflation, said Morgan Stanley economist Jacob Nell.",
            "“The basic idea with sanctions is that you’re trying to act in a way that causes more pain to the other side and less pain to yourself,” he said.",
            "Most American companies dealing in metals have longstanding relationships with Russian suppliers. Such trade, particularly of aluminum, has continued virtually uninterrupted since the beginning of the war.",
            "AP found more than 900 shipments totaling more than 264 million tons of metals since February. Russia is one of the largest producers of unwrought aluminum outside of China and a significant global exporter. But the war has affected that global market as well.",
            "“Like all manufacturers,” said Aluminum Association spokesperson Matt Meenan, “we have seen supply chain impacts in terms of increased energy costs and other inflationary pressures which the invasion exacerbated.”",
            "Russian aluminum ends up in American car parts and airplanes, soda cans and cables, ladders and solar racks. The largest U.S. buyer at the start of 2022 was a subsidiary of Russian-owned global aluminum giant Rusal. In April, Rusal America’s senior executives bought the U.S.-based part of the company and rebranded it as PerenniAL. In July alone, PerenniAL imported more than 35,000 tons from Russia. The company did not respond to requests for comment.",
            "Also, among the private companies choosing to source materials from Russia are U.S. government contractors supported by federal tax dollars. Boeing, the world’s largest aerospace company signed a federal contract for up to $23.8 billion in 2021; it imported 20 tons of aluminum in June from Kamensk-Uralsky Metallurgical Works. In March, the U.S. banned exports to Kamensk-Uralsky because it supplies metals to the Russian military, but placed no restrictions on imports. A Boeing representative said the company made the decision to end trade with Russia in March, and explained that the shipment that arrived in June had been purchased four months before.",
            "Another metal importer, Tirus US, is owned by Russian company VSMPO-AVISMA, the world’s largest titanium producer. VSMPO also provides metal to the Russian military to build fighter jets. The company’s broad global footprint and specific product — titanium — underscores the challenges of isolating Russia from global trade. Tirus US sells titanium to more than 300 companies in 48 countries, including a range of U.S. buyers, from jewelry makers to aerospace companies.",
            "The company said only that due to significant challenges in the U.S., it has been working with several American companies to alleviate supply chain issues.",
            "WOOD",
            "Russia’s vast forests are some of the largest in the world. After Canada, Russia is the second largest exporter of wood, and has some of the only mills that can make strong, solid Baltic birch plywood, flooring used throughout the U.S.",
            "This year, the Biden administration began imposing tariffs on Russian wood exports, a move which infuriated Ronald Liberatori, a Nevada-based wood dealer who sells Russian grown Baltic birch to all the major furniture makers, construction companies and flooring manufacturers in the U.S.",
            "“The problem here is Russia is the only country in the world that makes this product,” he said. “There’s no alternative source.”",
            "He said that on top of the tariff, he had to put up an $800,000 bond to ensure he’d pay the tax, further driving up prices.",
            "“Who’s paying for this? Who? You and every other individual in the United States,” he said. “We’re so damned upset with what Biden has done. This is a government versus government issue.”",
            "Liberatori said decision-makers need to consider who is going to be more hurt by tariffs before imposing them.",
            "Another wood and paper importer told AP that while it stopped any new orders in February, it had vast amounts of lumber in Russia that already had been paid for; the final shipment arrived in the U.S. in July.",
            "FUEL",
            "On March 8, Biden announced the United States is banning all imports of Russian oil, gas and energy, “targeting the main artery of Russia’s economy.”",
            "“That means Russian oil will no longer be acceptable at U.S. ports, and the American people will deal another powerful blow to Putin’s war machine,” he said.",
            "Within hours, there were reports that a ship carrying 1 million barrels of Russian oil to the U.S. changed course to France. But plenty of others pushed on.",
            "That week, about a million barrels of Russian crude oil had arrived off the port of Philadelphia, bound for Delta Airlines’ oil refinery Monroe Energy. Meanwhile, a tanker with about 75,000 barrels of Russian tar oil pulled into the port of Texas City, Texas, bound for Valero’s refineries after a long north Atlantic crossing, according to trade records.",
            "The shipments continued to Valero, ExxonMobil and others. ExxonMobil media manager Julie King told AP a July oil delivery was of Kazakh origin and not subject to sanctions. She said Exxon “supports the internationally coordinated efforts to bring Russia’s unprovoked attack to an end, and are complying with all sanctions.”",
            "Monroe spokesman Adam Gattuso said the company has not received any more Russian fuel and doesn’t “anticipate doing so for the foreseeable future.” Valero did not respond to requests for comment.",
            "Andrea Schlaepfer, a spokesperson for Dutch fuel exporter Vitol, said that all of its oil and gas shipments since April 22 have been from Kazakhstan, where pipelines and rail networks run from the landlocked country’s oil fields and refineries to neighboring Russian ports.",
            "For the use of its port infrastructure, moorings and fees, Russia makes about $10 million each year.",
            "Schlaepfer said U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents review and verify that its shipments entering the U.S. don’t contain Russian products. But CBP did not answer repeated questions about how it handles sanctions and bans on Russian goods. A CBP fact sheet says it plays a “critical role” in enforcing prohibitions on imports, however a spokesman repeatedly referred The AP to the State and Treasury departments.",
            "OTHER",
            "So far this year, almost 4,000 tons of Russian bullets have also arrived in the U.S., where they were distributed to gun shops and ammo dealers. Some were sold to U.S. buyers by Russian state-owned companies, while others came from at least one sanctioned oligarch. Those shipments slowed significantly after April.",
            "AP also tracked millions of dollars worth of shipments of radioactive uranium hexafluoride from Russian state-owned Tenex JSC, the world’s largest exporter of initial nuclear fuel cycle products, to Westinghouse Electric Co. in South Carolina. Nuclear material is not sanctioned.",
            "Westinghouse spokeswoman Cathy Mann said that as part of the nuclear fuel manufacturing process, their fuel fabrication facilities receive enriched uranium product and convert it into fuel pellets. She said Westinghouse doesn’t own the uranium used to make fuel. That material belongs to customers who operate nuclear power plants throughout the world.",
            "“As a result, our customers have the accountability to determine where and from whom the materials are procured – some of which is sourced from Russia or enriched by a Russian company,” she said. “Westinghouse condemns Russia’s invasion and the resulting hostility and loss of life.”",
            "In addition, some of the products sent to the U.S. from Russian ports continue on to Mexico and Canada. Toyota vehicle components, for example, arrived last month in New Orleans bound for a Mexican plant run by Toyota Tshusho, the car company’s trading arm.",
            "Radioactive material sent from Russia to the U.S. is hauled north of the border to sterilize packaged medical supplies used throughout North America.",
            "Although imports of some food items, such as seafood and vodka, have been restricted, the Treasury Department last month published a fact sheet reiterating that agricultural trade between the U.S. and Russia is still very much allowed.",
            "The Red October chocolate factory sits just across from the Kremlin in Moscow. Today it’s a tourist attraction with apartments, stores and restaurants. But the company, Krasny Oktyabr, still makes and sells candy and other traditional treats from a production plant on the outskirts of Russia.",
            "In Brooklyn, New York, Grigoriy Katsura, at the U.S. offices of Krasnyi Oktyabr Inc, said they continue to import delectables, a taste of childhood for Russian immigrants.",
            "“Of course they’re used to it,” he said.",
            "And so every few weeks, the shipments arrive at their warehouse from Russia: buckwheat, dried fruit and their world-renowned chocolate.",

            "“As we have said throughout this process, REI believes in the right of every employee to vote for or against union representation,” the company said in a statement following the vote count. “We fully supported the vote process in Berkeley and will continue to support our employees going forward.”",
            "The organizing success at REI follows other recent, notable labor victories at Amazon, Starbucks, Apple and Trader Joe’s, all of which have seen their workers unionize for the first time in recent months. Labor officials have reported a surge in election petitions this year as more workers try to come together to bargain collectively.",
            "Bloomberg Law reported new data earlier this week showing that unions won 639 elections between January and June of this year, labor’s best showing for the first half of the year in almost two decades. However, union membership is still hovering near a historic low, with a mere one in ten workers belonging to a union last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
            "REI, which is structured as a customer cooperative, has more than 170 stores around the country, many of them in liberal urban centers where union support would be high. Given the success of the first two campaigns, the company may well face organizing efforts at other stores in the near future.",
            "The workers in SoHo organized with the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, an affiliate of the UFCW, which will represent the workers in Berkeley. Both unions have a long history of representing workers in the retail, grocery and meatpacking industries.",
            "Having won their elections, the SoHo and Berkeley workers now face the more daunting task of trying to bargain a first contract. It can take years for workers to secure a collective bargaining agreement after successfully unionizing, and some never manage to do so. Although they are separate unions, the two groups may coordinate their strategies and demands with the company at the bargaining table.",
            "Most companies have been fighting these new organizing efforts, and REI has been no different, despite its progressive reputation. The company produced a widely mocked podcast earlier this year aimed at discouraging employees from unionizing (the episode began with Indigenous land acknowledgments by the speakers).",
            "The Berkeley employees created a petition calling on the company to “stop the union-busting,” saying REI was using “textbook” tactics to “scare” them.",
            "“They’ve told us our relationship with management will have to change, our existing benefits and retirement will go away, and a union representative will be required to attend our reviews,” the petition read. “They even told someone that they would need the union’s approval to go on vacation.”"

            "ATLANTA (AP) — The judge presiding over a special grand jury that’s investigating possible illegal attempts to influence the 2020 election in Georgia is wading into a fight over whether Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has to testify before the panel.",
            "Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney, who’s supervising the special grand jury, scheduled a hearing for Thursday morning after a dispute between lawyers for the governor and Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis’ team of prosecutors escalated from tense emails to court filings in recent weeks.",
            "The increasingly heated rhetoric is playing out as the Republican governor, who is seeking reelection in the fall, seeks to avoid speaking to a special grand jury looking into whether former President Donald Trump and his allies broke any laws as they tried to overturn Trump’s narrow election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Kemp’s lawyers have accused Willis, a Democrat, of pursuing his testimony for “improper political purposes,” an allegation the district attorney strongly denies.",
            "Willis’ investigation was prompted by a January 2021 phone call between Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger during which the then-president suggested the state’s top election official could “find” the votes needed to overturn his loss.",
            "Raffensperger and some other state officials have already appeared before the special grand jury, but Kemp is one of a number of potential witnesses who are fighting orders to testify.",
            "U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., whose telephone calls to Raffensperger and his staff in the weeks after the election are of interest to prosecutors, was supposed to testify earlier this week, but a federal appeals court put that on hold while he fights his subpoena.",
            "A judge in Texas last week ordered Dallas-based lawyer and podcaster Jacki Pick to travel to Atlanta to testify, and her attempt to challenge that order was denied Tuesday by an appeals court. Pick, who’s also known as Jacki Deason, gave a presentation before a Georgia legislative committee in December 2020 in which she alleged fraud by election workers at State Farm Arena in Atlanta.",
            "Willis has said she’s considering summoning Trump himself to appear before the grand jury, a step that would surely set off a legal fight. The high-stakes investigation is one in a string of serious legal threats the former president is facing.",
            "Willis told Kemp attorney Brian McEvoy in a June email that she and her team wanted to ask the governor, among other things, about the call between Trump and Raffensperger. Trump also called Kemp in December 2020 asking him to order a special legislative session to secure the state’s electoral votes for him.",
            "After an agreement to have the governor sit for a recorded interview fell apart, the district attorney’s office got a subpoena to have the governor testify on Aug. 18, according to court filings. The day before he was to testify, Kemp’s lawyers filed a motion to quash that subpoena.",
            "During Thursday’s hearing, McBurney will determine whether Kemp has to abide by the subpoena.",
            "Kemp’s lawyers argue that he is protected from testifying about his official duties by “sovereign immunity,” a principle that says the state can’t be sued without its consent. They also cited executive privilege, saying any material related to the governor’s deliberative process and communications is protected. And they raised attorney-client privilege, saying the governor routinely sought advice from his office’s attorneys in relation to the 2020 election and shouldn’t have to testify about that.",
            "Willis’ team has argued that sovereign immunity and executive privilege don’t apply in this case and that they would avoid any topic that may be subject to attorney-client privilege.",

            "TOKYO (AP) — Japan’s national police chief said Thursday he will resign to take responsibility over the fatal shooting of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at a campaign speech last month.",
            "National Police Agency Chief Itaru Nakamura’s announcement came as his agency released a report blaming flaws in police protection — from planning to guarding at the scene — that led to Abe’s assassination July 8 in Nara in western Japan.",
            "Nakamura said he took the former prime minister’s death seriously and that he submitted his resignation to the National Public Safety Commission earlier Thursday.",
            "“In order to fundamentally reexamine guarding and never to let this happen, we need to have a new system,” Nakamura told a news conference as he announced his intention to step down.",
            "Nakamura did not say when his resignation would be official. Japanese media reported that his resignation is expected to be approved at Friday’s Cabinet meeting.",
            "The alleged gunman, Tetsuya Yamagami, was arrested at the scene and is currently under mental evaluation until late November. Yamagami told police that he targeted Abe because of the former leader’s link to the Unification Church, which he hated.",
            "Abe sent a video message last year to a group affiliated with the church, which experts say may have infuriated the shooting suspect.",
            "In a 54-page investigative report released Thursday, the National Police Agency concluded that the protection plan for Abe neglected potential danger coming from behind him and merely focused on risks during his movement from the site of his speech to his vehicle.",
            "Inadequacies in the command system, communication among several key police officials, as well as their attention in areas behind Abe at the campaign site led to their lack of attention on the suspect’s movement until it was too late.",
            "None of the officers assigned to immediate protection of Abe caught the suspect until he was already 7 meters (yards) behind him where he took out his homemade double-barrel gun, which resembled a camera with a long lens, to blast his first shot that narrowly missed Abe. Up to that moment, none of the officers was aware of the suspect’s presence, the report said.",
            "In just over two seconds, the suspect was only 5.3 meters (yards) behind Abe to fire the second shot.",
            "The report said the prefectural police’s Abe protection plan lacked a thorough safety evaluation. It called for significant strengthening in both training and staffing of Japan’s dignitary protection, as well as revising police protection guidelines for the first time in about 30 years.",
            "The national police called for doubling dignitary protection staff, greater supervisory role for the national police over prefectural staff, and use of digital technology and drones to bolster surveillance from above ground.",
            "Abe’s family paid tribute to him in a private Buddhist ritual Thursday marking the 49th day since his assassination.",
            "In Nara, prefectural police chief Tomoaki Onizuka also expressed his intention to step down over Abe’s assassination.",
            "The church, which was founded in South Korea in 1954 and came to Japan a decade later, has built close ties with a host of conservative lawmakers, many of them members of Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party on their shared interests of anti-communism.",
            "Since the 1980s, the church has faced accusations of problematic recruiting and religious sales in Japan, and the governing party’s church ties have sent support ratings of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s Cabinet into a nosedive even after its recent shuffle."

            "NEW YORK ― With a slim lead over his nearest rival, Dan Goldman, the former federal prosecutor who led House Democrats’ 2019 impeachment case against then-President Donald Trump, declared victory on Tuesday evening in his race for the Democratic nomination in New York’s 10th Congressional District.",
            "The primary election in the solidly Democratic seat has not been officially called by The Associated Press.",
            "“This has been an inspiring and humbling experience for a first-time candidate and to stand in front of you here today as your Democratic nominee for Congress,” Goldman declared to cheering supporters at a brewery in Soho. “And while we will appreciate and respect the democratic process and make sure that all the votes are counted, it is quite clear from the way that the results have come in that we have won.”",
            "When Goldman made the announcement at 10:30 p.m., he had a lead of less than 2 percentage points over New York Assembly member Yuh-Line Niou. Niou announced around the same time that she would not concede in the race.",
            "“I know that tonight’s results aren’t yet what we want to hear, but we will not concede until we count every vote,” she told supporters.",
            "There may not be official results in the race for another week as outstanding absentee ballots are counted.",
            "In the Manhattan portion of the district, 10,679 people requested absentee ballots and just 3,881 had been returned as of Tuesday. And in the Brooklyn portion of the district, 10,823 people requested absentee ballots and just 3,968 had been returned.",
            "If a person returning an absentee ballot gets it postmarked by the Tuesday election day, it will still be eligible to be counted if it arrives by Aug. 30.",
            "With nearly 99% of the in-person ballots ― and absentee ballots that have already arrived ― counted, Goldman held a lead of just over 1,300 votes. That means there is technically a chance for Niou to win if there are a number of absentee ballots that come in in the coming days and they skew heavily toward Niou."

            "Mullin, who owns a plumbing company in northeast Oklahoma, beat former state House Speaker T.W. Shannon to make it to the November ballot. He will face Democrat Kendra Horn, a former congresswoman from the Oklahoma City area, but the seat is considered safely Republican.",
            "In his five terms in the House, Mullin carved out a reputation as a defender of former President Donald Trump and a staunch critic of President Joe Biden.",
            "In a news conference with fellow Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee after the FBI’s search of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, Mullin asked why people should trust U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland.",
            "“What has caused him to think that the American people should trust him? Is it the way that they handled Hillary Clinton’s case with her emails? Is it the Russia collusion?” he asked.",
            "Mullin also has bought into the false belief that Biden lost the 2020 election. In a televised debate with Shannon, Mullin said, “It’s absurd to think that Joe Biden received more votes than any president in history. We have to fight to make sure every vote is counted accurately.”",
            "But Mullin may be best known for his actions in 2021 in the wake of the chaotic evacuation of U.S. troops and citizens from Afghanistan after the government fell surprisingly quickly to the fundamentalist Taliban.",
            "Mullin tried to sneak into the country to help Americans who were trapped there and unable to get to the Kabul airport to evacuate. But his plan to hire a helicopter to fly into Afghanistan from neighboring Tajikistan went astray when a U.S. Embassy official in Tajikistan told the congressman he would not help him skirt limits on taking cash into the country, according to The Washington Post.",

            "Charlie Crist on Tuesday won the Democratic nomination for Florida governor, giving him a second shot at the job he once held as a Republican.",
            "Crist easily defeated Nikki Fried, the sitting agriculture commissioner and currently the only Democrat in a statewide office, which now allows him to take on incumbent Gov. Ron DeSantis. The Florida Republican has spent recent months campaigning around the country as a prelude to a widely expected 2024 presidential run.",
            "Crist focused on that in the eight-minute victory speech he gave just 17 minutes after polls closed in the state’s Panhandle counties located in the Central time zone. “This guy wants to be president of the United States, and everybody knows it. However, when we defeat him on Nov. 8, that show is over,” he said to cheers. “Gov. DeSantis only cares about the White House. He doesn’t care about your house.”",
            "Fried, who for much of the year-and-a-half primary campaign had lagged far behind in polling, seemed to gain momentum in recent weeks thanks to a surge of women voters angered by the U.S. Supreme Court striking down Roe v. Wade.",
            "That boost, though, proved ephemeral, as Democratic voters appeared to make a pragmatic decision about who would be best able to defeat DeSantis: Fried, who appealed the most to young and progressive voters, or Crist, preferred by older and more moderate Floridians.",
            "Crist won most of the state’s large metro areas by two-to-one margins, including in Broward County, Fried’s home base, and late Tuesday led statewide 60% to 35%.",
            "Four years earlier, Democrats picked the progressives’ favorite, Andrew Gillum, over the more moderate Gwen Graham, only to see him lose narrowly to DeSantis in a strong year for Democrats.",
            "In his remarks Tuesday, Crist repeated a theme he hit often in the primary campaign: that he can create a coalition of voters, including moderate Republicans, who are turned off by DeSantis’ aggressive style.",
            "“We can unite Democrats, independents, and many Republicans who care about our Florida, and we will defeat Ron DeSantis,” he said.",
            "As he attempts to do this, though, Crist faces a steep climb.",
            "No sitting governor has lost reelection in Florida since 1990, and that only happened because Republican Bob Martinez was challenged by the immensely popular Lawton Chiles, who had already served three terms in the U.S. Senate.",
            "Crist also faces a staggering financial disadvantage heading into the general election just two and a half months away. Florida campaign finance records show that between his campaign and his political committee, Crist had just $1.5 million available to spend on Aug. 18, the close of the final pre-primary filing period, after having raised and spent a total of $15.2 million to defeat Fried.",
            "In contrast, DeSantis, who had no primary challenger, has a total of $132 million available to spend and is likely to raise many tens of millions more in the coming weeks.",
            "Whether Democrats in Florida and around the country will be willing to spend heavily on a long-shot race remains to be seen, particularly with winnable governor’s races on the line in states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Arizona.",
            "For Crist, meanwhile, Tuesday’s win allows him a chance to end a losing streak of two statewide defeats in a row, starting with his failed U.S. Senate run in 2010, first as a Republican, then as an independent. He then lost a close race in 2014 as a Democrat trying to win back the governor’s mansion that he had occupied from 2007-2011 as a Republican.",
            "Previously, in statewide races as a Republican, he lost a bid for U.S. Senate in 1998, won the education commissioner’s job in 2000, and was elected state attorney general in 2002. He is currently a third-term Democratic congressman representing the St. Petersburg area."

            "The climate, healthcare and tax legislation signed into law by President Joe Biden last week included $80 billion in funding for tax collection efforts. Although Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen specifically directed the agency to not focus its attention on taxpayers with middle class incomes, misinformation spread rapidly on line that agents were going to crack down on taxpayers of all earnings levels.",
            "The baseless assertions also said the IRS would distribute firearms to employees authorized to used deadly force, prompting threats to the IRS employees.",

            "“For me this is personal. I’ll continue to make every effort to dispel any lingering misperceptions about our work,” Rettig said in a Tuesday letter to employees. “And I will continue to advocate for your safety in every venue where I have an audience.”",

            "Reardon said several workers have talked about being reminded of the 2010 Austin, Texas suicide attack, where Andrew Joseph Stack III deliberately crashed his single engine plane into the Echelon office building, killing himself and Internal Revenue Service manager Vernon Hunter.",

            "WASHINGTON (AP) — Millions of Americans were waiting to learn the fate of their federal student debt on Wednesday as President Joe Biden was set to deliver on his campaign promise to provide $10,000 in debt cancellation for many Americans — and up to $10,000 more for those with the greatest financial need.",
            "Details of the plan have been kept closely guarded, but borrowers who earn less than $125,000 a year, or families earning less than $250,000, would be eligible for the $10,000 loan forgiveness, according to three people familiar with the decision. For recipients of Pell Grants, which are reserved for undergraduates with the most significant financial need, the federal government would cancel up to an additional $10,000 in federal loan debt, according to a copy of administration talking points obtained by the Associated Press.",
            "Biden is also set to extend a pause on federal student loan payments for what the White House calls the “final time” through the end of 2022.",
            "If his plan survives legal challenges that are almost certain to come, it could offer a windfall to a swath of the nation in the run-up to this fall’s midterm elections. More than 43 million people have federal student debt, with an average balance of $37,667, according to federal data. Nearly a third of borrowers owe less than $10,000, and about half owe less than $20,000. The White House estimates that Biden’s announcement would erase the federal student debt of about 20 million people.",
            "Proponents say cancellation will narrow the racial wealth gap — Black students are more likely to borrow federal student loans and at higher amounts than others. Four years after earning bachelor’s degrees, Black borrowers owe an average of nearly $25,000 more than their white peers, according to a Brookings Institution study.",
            "Still, the action is unlikely to thrill any of the factions that have been jostling for influence as Biden weighs how much to cancel and for whom.",
            "Biden has faced pressure from liberals to provide broader relief to hard-hit borrowers, and from moderates and Republicans questioning the fairness of any widespread forgiveness. The delay in Biden’s decision has only heightened the anticipation for what his own aides acknowledge represents a political no-win situation. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss Biden’s intended announcement ahead of time.",
            "The continuation of the coronavirus pandemic-era payment freeze comes just days before millions of Americans were set to find out when their next student loan bills will be due. This is the closest the administration has come to hitting the end of the payment freeze extension, with the current pause set to end Aug. 31.",
            "According to the administration’s talking points, the Education Department will release information in the coming weeks for eligible borrowers to sign up for debt relief. Cancellation for some would be automatic, if the department has access to to their income information, but others would need to fill out a form.",
            "Current students would only be eligible for relief if their loans were originated before July 1, 2022. Biden is also set to propose capping the amount that borrowers pay monthly on undergraduate loans at 5% of their earnings.",
            "Wednesday’s announcement was set for the White House after Biden returns from vacation in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.",
            "During the 2020 presidential campaign, Biden was initially skeptical of student loan debt cancellation as he faced off against more progressive candidates for the Democratic nomination. Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., had proposed cancellations of $50,000 or more.",
            "As he tried to shore up support among younger voters and prepare for a general election battle against President Donald Trump, Biden unveiled his initial proposal for debt cancellation of $10,000 per borrower, with no mention of an income cap.",
            "Biden narrowed his campaign promise in recent months by embracing the income limit as soaring inflation took a political toll and as he aimed to head off political attacks that the cancellation would benefit those with higher take-home pay. But Democrats, from members of congressional leadership to those facing tough reelection bids this November, have pushed the administration to go as broad as possible on debt relief, seeing it in part as a galvanizing issue, particularly for Black and young voters this fall.",
            "Democrats are betting that Biden, who has seen his public approval tumble over the past year, can help motivate younger voters to the polls with the announcement.",
            "Although Biden’s plan is narrower than what he initially proposed during the campaign, “he’ll get a lot of credit for following through on something that he was committed to,” said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who worked with Biden during the 2020 election.",
            "A survey of 18- to 29-year-olds conducted by the Harvard Institute of Politics in March found that 59% of those polled favored debt cancellation of some sort — whether for all borrowers or those most in need — although student loans did not rank high among issues that most concerned people in that age group.",
            "Some advocates say Biden’s plan still falls short.",
            "“If the rumors are true, we’ve got a problem,” Derrick Johnson, the president of the NAACP, which has aggressively lobbied Biden to take bolder action, said Tuesday.",
            "“President Biden’s decision on student debt cannot become the latest example of a policy that has left Black people — especially Black women — behind,” he said. “This is not how you treat Black voters who turned out in record numbers and provided 90% of their vote to once again save democracy in 2020.”",
            "John Della Volpe, who worked as a consultant on Biden’s campaign and is the director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics, said the particulars of Biden’s announcement were less important than the decision itself.",
            "“It’s about trust in politics, in government, in our system. It’s also about trust in the individual, which in this case is President Biden,” Della Volpe said.",
            "Republicans, meanwhile, see a political upside if Biden pursues a large-scale cancellation of student debt ahead of the November midterms, anticipating backlash for Democrats — particularly in states where there are large numbers of working-class voters without college degrees. Critics of broad student debt forgiveness also believe it will open the White House to lawsuits, on the grounds that Congress has never given the president the explicit authority to cancel debt on his own.",
            "The Republican National Committee on Tuesday blasted Biden’s expected announcement as a “handout to the rich,” claiming it would unfairly burden lower-income taxpayers and those who have already paid off their student loans with covering the costs of higher education for the wealthy.",
            "Biden’s long deliberations have led to grumbling among federal loan servicers, who had been instructed to hold back billing statements while Biden weighed a decision.",
            "Industry groups had complained that the delayed decision left them with just days to notify borrowers, retrain customer service workers and update websites and digital payment systems, said Scott Buchanan, executive director of the Student Loan Servicing Alliance.",
            "It increases the risk that some borrowers will inadvertently be told they need to make payments, he said.",
            "“At this late stage I think that’s the risk we’re running,” he said. “You can’t just turn on a dime with 35 million borrowers who all have different loan types and statuses.”",

            "HBO’s “House of the Dragon” soared well above expectations, marking the largest audience for an original series premiere in the cable giant’s history.",
            "Nearly 10 million viewers in the U.S. tuned into the opening episode of the “Game of Thrones” prequel on Sunday, according to Warner Bros. Discovery, which noted that night-of ratings typically only represent 20 to 40 percent of the show’s total gross audience.",
            "The network said 9.986 million viewers caught the series premiere across HBO and its streaming platform, HBO Max. That viewership towered above HBO’s other recent launches, including the second season of “Euphoria,” which drew 2.2 million viewers, and “Succession,” which opened with 1.4 million viewers for its season three debut.",
            "“It was wonderful to see millions of Game of Thrones fans return with us to Westeros last night,” Casey Bloys, chief content officer of HBO and HBO Max, said in a news release. “House of the Dragon features an incredibly talented cast and crew who poured their heart and soul into the production, and we’re ecstatic with viewers’ positive response. We look forward to sharing with audiences what else [author George R.R. Martin and showrunners Ryan Condal and Miguel Sapochnik] have in store for them this season.”",
            "“Game of Thrones,” which pulled in 2.22 million viewers for its pilot episode in 2011, also experienced a major ratings upswing, capping off its strongest week on HBO Max to date, according to the network. Viewership is nearly 90 percent above last month on the heels of a seven-week stretch of week-over-week growth.",
            "The long-awaited return to Westeros also proved to be hit across social media, as the “House of the Dragon” became a trending Twitter topic for 14 hours straight, as well as topping Google Trends, per the press release.",
            "The ratings success for “House of the Dragon” comes at a turning point for HBO and HBO Max, as it plans to merge with Discovery+ into a single streaming platform next year. The pending merge has resulted in HBO Max purging a host of original series and films from its library, drawing significant ire from both fans and creatives behind the projects.",
            "As the first major launch after the formation of Warner Bros. Discovery, the company took no chances on “House of the Dragon,” pouring millions of dollars ― a Deadline report puts the figure north of $100 million ― into marketing. The prequel series reportedly cost under $20 million per episode to produce for the 10-episode first season.",
            "“House of the Dragon” is set hundreds of years before the events of “Thrones” and based on Martin’s 2018 novel, “Fire & Blood.” It chronicles the events leading up to a civil war that tears the ruling House of Targaryen apart.",
            "The series, which is co-created by Martin and overseen by showrunners Ryan Condal and Miguel Sapochnik, stars Matt Smith, Milly Alcock, Paddy Considine, Emily Carey, Rhys Ifans, Steve Toussaint, Eve Best, Fabien Frankel, and Sonoya Mizuno, Emma D’Arcy and Olivia Cooke."

            "LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — A former Louisville police detective who helped falsify the warrant that led to the deadly police raid at Breonna Taylor’s apartment has pleaded guilty to a federal conspiracy charge.",
            "Federal investigators said Kelly Goodlett added a false line to the warrant and later conspired with another detective to create a cover story when Taylor’s March 13, 2020, shooting death by police began gaining national attention.",
            "Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman, was shot to death by officers who knocked down her door while executing a drug search warrant. Taylor’s boyfriend fired a shot that hit one of the officers as they came through the door and they returned fire, striking Taylor multiple times.",
            "Goodlett, 35, appeared in a federal courtroom in Louisville on Tuesday afternoon and admitted to conspiring with another Louisville police officer to falsify the warrant. Goodlett briefly answered several questions from federal judge Rebecca Jennings Grady.",
            "Taylor’s mother, Tamika Palmer, was in the courtroom Tuesday but did not speak after the proceedings.",
            "Three former Louisville officers were indicted on criminal civil rights charges earlier this month by a federal grand jury. Goodlett was not indicted, but charged in a federal information filing, which likely means the former detective is cooperating with investigators.",
            "Goodlett will be sentenced Nov. 22. Grady said there may be “extenuating circumstances” that may move the court to push back the sentencing date. Part of the plea hearing was also kept under seal and was not discussed in open court Tuesday. She faces up to five years in prison for the conviction.",
            "She resigned from the department Aug. 5, a day after U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland announced new federal charges in the Taylor case.",
            "Former officers Joshua Jaynes and Kyle Meany were indicted on charges related to the warrant used to search Taylor’s home. A third former officer, Brett Hankison, was charged with using excessive force when he retreated from Taylor’s door, turned a corner and fired 10 shots into the side of her two-bedroom apartment. He was acquitted by a jury on similar state charges earlier this year. Jaynes, Meany and Hankison have all been fired.",
            "The three former officers face a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted on the civil rights charges.",
            "Federal prosecutors said in court records that Jaynes, who drew up the Taylor warrant, had claimed to Goodlett days before the warrant was served that he had “verified” from a postal inspector that a suspected drug dealer was receiving packages at Taylor’s apartment. But Goodlett knew this was false and told Jaynes the warrant did not yet have enough information connecting Taylor to criminal activity, prosecutors said. She added a paragraph saying the suspected drug dealer, Jamarcus Glover, was using Taylor’s apartment as his current address, according to the court records.",
            "Two months later, when the Taylor shooting was attracting national headlines, the postal inspector told a media outlet he had not verified packages for Glover were going to Taylor’s apartment. Jaynes and Goodlett then met in Jaynes’ garage to “get on the same page” before Jaynes talked to investigators about the Taylor warrant, court records said.",
            "They decided to say Sgt. John Mattingly, who is identified in the court records as J.M., told them Glover was receiving packages at Taylor’s home, according to prosecutors. Mattingly was shot in the leg during the raid at Taylor’s apartment.",
            "Meany, who signed off on the Taylor warrant and was still a Louisville police sergeant when he was indicted on Aug. 4, was fired by Louisville Police Chief Erika Shields on Friday.",
            "Shields said in a statement that Meany has not yet had his case heard by a jury, but “he is facing multiple federal charges after a lengthy investigation by the DOJ” and should not “expect continued employment under such conditions.”",
            "Hankison was the only officer charged who was on the scene the night of the killing."

            "Jerry Allison, a pioneering rock drummer who worked with rock legend Buddy Holly and his band The Crickets, died Monday at age 82.",
            "Allison’s death was announced via a post on the official Buddy Holly Facebook page, which stated:",
            "“JI was a musician ahead of his time, and undoubtedly his energy, ideas and exceptional skill contributed to both The Crickets, and rock n’ roll itself, becoming such a success.“Buddy is often heralded as the original singer-songwriter, but JI, too, wrote and inspired so many of the songs that would go on to be eternal classics.”",
            "Allison was Holly’s good friend and collaborator and co-wrote some of their most enduring songs, including “That’ll Be The Day,” “Not Fade Away,” and “Peggy Sue,” which was named after Allison’s first wife.",
            "Born in 1939, Allison started playing the drums after his family moved to Lubbock, Texas, when he was 10, according to Variety.",
            "Allison told Lubbock Online in 2012 that he was inspired to “whack the drums” after seeing a halftime show at a football game. Although he joined the school band, his musical career went in a different direction after he met Holly in junior high.",
            "“We met in the school yard at J.T. Hutchinson Junior High School. But we did not become best friends until some time in high school,” Allison remembered. “Buddy and [bassist] Bob Montgomery played for a school assembly program during my eighth-grade year, and it affected me like marching band in the fifth grade. It was the very best live music I had heard up to then.”",
            "Although Allison did briefly play in the Texas Tech school band, he dropped out as his music career took off.",
            "“Buddy got us a job backing Hank Thompson and George Jones and others for two weeks. We traveled 6,000 miles in two weeks,” he told Texas Music Monthly. “I couldn’t stay in college.”",
            "Holly and Allison decided to name their band the Crickets after being inspired by a band called the Spiders.",
            "“We looked in the dictionary under insects and stopped at cricket. We had a lot of crickets in Texas that year, too,” Allison said.",
            "Allison and Holly wrote the breakthrough hit “That’ll Be The Day” after seeing “The Searchers,” a John Wayne Western that features the actor saying the line throughout the film.",
            "“Buddy said, ‘Let’s write a song,’ and I said, ‘That’ll be the day!’ We worked on it for about half an hour,” Allison recalled.",
            "Although legendary country music producer Owen Bradley dismissed the song as “one of the worst” he had ever heard, Brunswick Records’ Bob Thiele signed Holly and the Crickets after he heard his kids playing the demo recording over and over again.",
            "Allison also helped Holly write “Peggy Sue,” which was originally called “Cindy Lou” after Holly’s niece. Allison convinced Holly to change the title to the name of his then-girlfriend and future wife, Peggy Sue Gerron.",
            "Allison approached percussion in innovative ways, such as by using a paradiddle beat on “Peggy Sue,” slapping his hands on his thighs for “Everyday,” and playing only tom-toms on the Everly Brothers’ 1960 hit “(Till) I Kissed You,” which was recorded after Holly’s death.",
            "He also had a minor hit in 1958 with “Real Wild Child,” which he recorded under the name Ivan.",
            "After Holly died in a plane crash in 1959, Allison continued recording with the Crickets and writing songs, including “More Than I Can Say,” which, in 1980, became a No. 2 hit for Leo Sayer.",
            "In addition, Allison and other members of the Crickets worked as Waylon Jennings’ backup band in the 1970s, and Allison recorded with artists including Bobby Vee, Nanci Griffith and Paul McCartney.",
            "Although Holly was inducted into the first class of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, the Crickets weren’t inducted until 2012. “That’ll Be The Day” was placed in the National Recording Registry in 2005.",
            "Allison last performed with the Crickets in 2016 before retiring to a farm outside Nashville."

            "Breaking news to Hollywood’s most annoying method actors: It’s possible to stay in character without “being an asshole,” according to Andrew Garfield.",
            "The “Spider-Man: No Way Home” star is doing his best to change the narrative about method acting, a practice that in recent years has included Jared Leto delaying “Morbius” filming by using fake crutches during pee breaks and “snorting lines of arrabbiata sauce” to prepare for “House of Gucci.”",
            "Garfield recently spoke out in defense of method acting, pushing back against “misconceptions” about the infamous practice, which he said has worked for him.",
            "“It’s not about being an asshole to everyone on set,” Garfield said during an episode of Marc Maron’s “WTF” podcast released on Monday. “It’s actually just about living truthfully under imagined circumstances, and being really nice to the crew simultaneously, and being a normal human being, and being able to drop it when you need to and staying in it when you want to stay in it.”",
            "“I’m kind of bothered by this idea that ‘method acting is fucking bullshit,’” he continued, noting that critics have likely worked with “someone who claims to be a method actor but who actually isn’t acting in the method at all.”",
            "The Oscar nominee said he prefers not to share the “very private” process of creating a character internally.",
            "“I don’t want people to see how I’m making the sausage,” Garfield said. “But it really, really is profound work.”",
            "The actor did, however, touch upon the extreme lengths he took to prepare for his role as a Jesuit priest in Martin Scorsese’s 2016 historical epic “Silence,” which he found to be a “an incredibly spiritual experience.”",
            "“I did a bunch of spiritual practices every day, I created new rituals for myself. I was celibate for six months, and fasting a lot, because me and [co-star Adam Driver] had to lose a bunch of weight anyway,” Garfield recalled, noting the entire process lasted a year. “It was very cool, man. I had some pretty wild, trippy experiences from starving myself of sex and food at that time.”",
            "While the process has paid off for Garfield, method acting has drawn some notable critics in recent years among a slew of actors, including David Harbour, Mads Mikkelsen, Sebastian Stan and Jon Bernthal.",
            "Harbour went as far to say that the process is “dangerous,” and “doesn’t produce good work,” while Stan described the approach as an “irresponsible, narcissistic, kind of self-indulgent thing.”",
            "Mikkelsen, meanwhile, simply blasted method acting as “bullshit.”"

            "Ousted Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers characterized Donald Trump and his supporters’ efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election as “fascism” — and is stunned that it’s his Republican Party that has declared war on the U.S. Constitution, he told The Guardian in an interview.",
            "“The thought that if you don’t do what we like, then we will just get rid of you and march on, and do it ourselves — that to me is fascism,” Bowers said in the interview published Sunday.",
            "“The constitution is hanging by a thread,” Bowers warned.",
            "“The funny thing is, I always thought it would be the other guys. And it’s my side. That just rips at my heart: that we would be the people who would surrender the constitution in order to win an election. That just blows my mind.”",
            "Bowers lost his Republican primary race for a state Senate seat early this month in a targeted retaliation for his refusal to cooperate with Trump and the former president’s attorney Rudy Giuliani to try to toss out Arizona’s votes for Democrat Joe Biden in an effort to reverse the outcome of the 2020 election.",
            "Bowers’ opponent David Farnsworth, who was endorsed by Trump, not only baselessly insisted the election Trump lost was rigged but that it was snatched by the “devil himself.”",
            "Bowers, a lifelong Republican who served in the Arizona House for 17 years, was one of the most compelling witnesses earlier this summer at a hearing before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.",
            "He recounted a high-pressure campaign by both Trump and Giuliani, who pushed him in a tense phone call to arbitrarily throw out the state’s electoral votes for Joe Biden.",
            "Giuliani insisted to Bowers that “200,000 illegal immigrants” and more than 5,000 “dead people” voted in the state, Bowers testified. Bowers said he told Giuliani “multiple times” that he needed proof and Giuliani had promised to provide it. But Bowers testified that he never received proof, not a single name of a fraudulent vote, he testified.",
            "“We’ve got lots of theories but we don’t have the evidence,” Giuliani later admitted, Bowers testified.“There was no ― no evidence being presented of any strength ... that would say to me, ‘You have a doubt. Deny your oath.’ I will not do that,” Bowers said of the men’s fraud claims.Bowers testified that it’s a “tenet” of his Mormon faith that the Constitution is “divinely inspired, one of my most basic foundational beliefs,” he added. “So for me to do that because somebody just asked me to is foreign to my very being.”He told The Guardian that he was thinking to himself at the time: “Wait, wait, wait ... you’re asking me to overthrow the vote of the people of Arizona?”",
            "Not only did the fourth-generation Arizonan find no evidence of fraud in his examination of voting in the state, he said he was not surprised Trump lost the election — though by just 10,000 votes in Arizona — he told The Guardian.",
            "“We were very much aware that a demographic of women, 18 to 40 [year old], college-educated, professional, with small children were not voting for Donald Trump,” he told The Guardian.",
            "Bowers voted for Trump in 2020 and campaigned for him. But now he sees Trump supporters’ adoption of conspiracy theories and bully tactics as a “prep game” for what was to come.",
            "Bowers is shaken but has no regrets for the stance he took, he told The Guardian.",
            "The GOP is now a party that “doesn’t have any thought. It’s all emotional, it’s all revenge. It’s all anger. That’s all it is, he said.",

            "Biden has faced pressure from liberals to provide broader relief to hard-hit borrowers, and from moderates and Republicans questioning the fairness of any widespread forgiveness. The delay in Biden’s decision has only heightened the anticipation for what his own aides acknowledge represents a political no-win situation.

            "Democrats in Congress were thrilled when President Joe Biden signed a landmark climate and health care bill into law last week. But the moment felt bittersweet for some ― among them, Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.).",
            "Dingell has been leading calls for a massive new investment in home and community-based services, or HCBS, which is the set of programs and supports that help the elderly and people with disabilities to live independently. The campaign has been personal for Dingell, who speaks frequently of the struggles she faced trying to find and coordinate care for her ailing husband, former Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), in his final years.",
            "Eighteen months ago, it looked like that campaign was on the cusp of success when a major HCBS proposal was part of Biden’s “Build Back Better” blueprint for coming legislation. And it wasn’t just HCBS getting a White House push. Similarly sweeping proposals for child care and paid leave were also in the plan. Together, they formed a caregiving agenda, with a goal to create for the U.S. something that already exists in most economically advanced countries: a cradle-to-grave guarantee that people will have assistance and care at the most vulnerable periods of their lives.",
            "But with wafer-thin majorities and no realistic prospect of Republican support, Democratic leaders were at the mercy of more conservative members who wanted a smaller, less ambitious bill. The caregiving items were competing for resources alongside other initiatives and the pool of resources kept shrinking with each round of negotiations ― until finally Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) made clear he would withhold his make-or-break 50th “yea” vote until Democrats dropped everything but the climate and health provisions.",
            "Dingell did her part to make sure the bill passed, celebrating the accomplishment with her colleagues. But she couldn’t stop thinking about the missing caregiving pieces, including the HCBS initiative, especially in the last few weeks when the issue once again became personal: She was simultaneously trying to arrange ongoing care for her 88-year-old mother, who was about to leave the hospital following a cardiac emergency, and once again struggling to identify and hire caregivers.",
            "“This system is so broken,” an exasperated Dingell told HuffPost in a phone interview, ticking off problems she’d had finding caregivers. “Just think about what this is like for somebody who doesn’t already know how to be an advocate, how to get things organized, think about how much it costs and all the people who can’t afford it.”",
            "Dingell said the experience has only reinforced her determination to get something done. “We didn’t get it done, but I just look at that as an opportunity to begin again,” she said.",
            "And she has plenty of company. In a series of interviews over the past two weeks, lawmakers, aides and advocates who worked on the caregiving agenda said they were in the same mindset, convinced that with more effort they could succeed.",
            "And they really might. Especially in recent history, success at major progressive reforms has followed high-profile, significant failures, whether it was the Affordable Care Act rising from the rubble of the Clinton health care plan or the new clean energy investments that Biden just signed emerging in the wake of the failed attempt to enact a “cap and trade” emissions program a decade ago.",
            "But that success didn’t happen by accident. It happened, at least in part, because Democrats went through some serious introspection ― taking stock of what went wrong and why, and how to avoid those problems in the future.",
            "The caregiving agenda supporters HuffPost interviewed all seemed to recognize this. They said those conversations are already taking place and that they already have some pretty good ideas about where the last effort came up short. But identifying problems is one thing. Solving them is quite another — especially when the political obstacles to progressive change of any kind remain so formidable.",
            "A Crisis That Felt Like An Opportunity",
            "That’s one reason the missed opportunity hurts so much: The political conditions of these past two years felt more favorable to enacting a caregiving agenda than ever before.",
            "The pandemic made clear how much families rely on paid care providers. It also illuminated underlying problems like the chronically low pay of care workers and the inability of providers to raise fees, which would allow them to boost pay, because the current prices max out so many families.",
            "One result has been widespread, well-publicized shortages of child care.",
            "“At least 16,000 programs have closed down permanently, while those that remain open are under immense strain from short-staffing pressures,” Elliot Haspel, senior program officer for early childhood education at the Robins Foundation, told HuffPost. “Parents are hitting a wall of waitlists while those who can finagle a spot are paying even more exorbitant fees than before. It’s not a complicated story: a fragile sector shattered.”",
            "The same basic dynamic of underpaid employees and employers who can’t (or won’t) pay them more is creating the shortage of home care workers that Dingell has seen firsthand and that has been generating headlines all across the country — in some cases, forcing seniors and people with disabilities to leave home and go back to institutional care settings.",
            "The pandemic has also thrown a spotlight onto the need for guaranteed paid leave, mainly by demonstrating what happens when workers don’t have it. They go to work sick, infecting others, or lose their wages and sometimes their jobs.",
            "Progress On Organizing, But Not Enough",
            "Advocates had something else going for them in the recent reform push. They were ready for the moment.",
            "They’d been preparing for years, putting together plans and legislation. They also committed to working together, which was no small thing given past rivalries and tension over competition for limited resources. “We had an agreement that we would lift all of these issues together, that we would not be pitted against each other,” Ai-jen Poo, president of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, told HuffPost.",
            "The unified front made them stronger and helped get buy-in from Democratic politicians, including the 2020 presidential candidates, all of whom included major caregiving proposals in their platforms. They also won support from the business community, mainly by demonstrating how care for children and elders, along with paid leave, helped to stabilize the workforce.",
            "But even as the corporate community was cheering on the caregiving initiatives, it was fighting the tax increases to finance the new programs. “I think that had a huge influence,” said Vicki Shabo, a longtime paid leave advocate who is now a senior fellow at New America, a Washington-based think tank.",
            "And while the caregiving movement is a lot more organized than it was even a few years ago, it doesn’t have the kind of advocacy or lobbying strength to overcome that kind of resistance — or even to ensure its priorities are something Democrats must address.",
            "“It’s clear that the sector still needs to build its power,” said Haspel, who is also author of “Crawling Behind: America’s Childcare Crisis and How to Fix It.” “Parents of young children are not feared as a constituency, and we simply don’t have the money or political clout to throw around in the way that health care or climate or hedge fund managers do — the lobbying numbers are pretty meager.”",
            "A Message That Not Enough People Have Gotten",
            "The common rationale for federal action on child care, HCBS and paid leave is that society should take some collective responsibility for caregiving, through public programs, rather than letting it all fall on individual families. But that can be a difficult message to get across, when so many Americans are unaccustomed to their government playing that role.",
            "“There is still a misimpression [in the U.S.] that these programs and supports are not core to what the government should do,” Shabo said.",
            "One way to change that impression is to publicize the instances where it is happening in the U.S. — which, for paid leave, means talking about states like California, Colorado and Maryland that have programs in place or are in the process of implementing them and documenting the results.",
            "Another is to try flipping the script on government action, which critics frequently portray as infringements on individual liberty.",
            "“These programs create freedom,” Poo said. “They’re enabling people’s participation in the economy, freedom to help people with disabilities live independently and full, actual lives, whole lives. They free us from the guilt and the shame that comes with feeling like a failure when you can’t afford or manage the care.”",
            "Advocates may also need to do a better job of simply conveying how far-reaching the impacts of caregiving are — partly to justify ambitious national action and partly to make sure people struggling in the current system realize it’s not their fault.",
            "“This is not a niche issue,” Poo said. “Fifty-three million family caregivers, and how many working parents who need child care? And then the number of boomers and older adults who are going to need these services in the next 10 to 15 years. ... The actual human cost and human impact of not moving on these issues and making progress, I don’t think it’s well enough understood.”",
            "“I feel like we were starting to chip away at this … but it is a deep, profound challenge,” Poo said.",
            "A Chance To Rethink Policy Too",
            "For the caregiving agenda to become reality, its supporters may have to do more than rethink politics. They may need to rethink policy too, by subjecting their ideas to more outside scrutiny and contemplating major changes.",
            "One big question is the role of states. Both the child care and HCBS proposals put up a lot of federal money but depended on states taking the money and using it. The hope was that even conservative state officials would not turn down a chance to help so many constituents. This is more or less what’s been happening during the pandemic, advocates noted: States have been accepting federal relief dollars to prop up child care without much political fuss.",
            "But the child care and HCBS proposals that were part of Build Back Better made the funds conditional on states making long-term changes to their programs, and committing to a small-but-ongoing contribution of state funding — which, as critics like Matt Bruenig of the People’s Policy Project pointed out, sounds a lot more like the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion that to this day a dozen Republican-led states have rejected.",
            "Figuring out a way to avoid this problem, while still allowing for state flexibility where it makes sense as policy, is something advocates say they are already contemplating. “Whatever we come up with for HCBS going forward, we want to make sure that every state, red or blue, gets the money,” said Nicole Jorwic, chief of advocacy and campaigns at Caring Across Generations.",
            "A bigger question is whether to engage in some kind of more wholesale rethinking of the existing caregiving proposals, like whether programs should devote some money to subsidizing people who stay home and provide care directly for loved ones. This has been the one criticism conservatives and Republicans frequently make about Democratic child care plans — that they don’t do enough for stay-at-home parents.",
            "Compromise And An Open Mind",
            "Rethinking proposals is never easy; the difficult trade-offs of policy and politics inevitably lead to less-than-ideal solutions. But the lawmakers and activists who spoke to HuffPost all said they were willing to be flexible and compromise — and pointed to concessions they made this past year, as they tried to save elements of their agenda, as proof.",
            "“I think sometimes there was sort of this idea that, you know, advocates were not willing to negotiate,” Dawn Huckelbridge, director of Paid Leave for All, told HuffPost. “And I think in each of our cases, that was absolutely not true.”",
            "She noted that original proposals for paid leave envisioned 12 weeks and that, by the end, supporters in and outside Congress were willing to make do with as little as four — figuring that, once the plan was in place, they would have opportunities to expand it.",
            "“What we often said was, for the majority of people in this country who have zero days of paid leave, this is transformative stuff,” Huckelbridge said. “So of course we’re not going to turn that down.”",
            "The lawmakers and advocates who have been working on the caregiving agenda also said they were open-minded about working with Republicans, whether it’s on short-term fixes or longer-term plans. As evidence of potential Republican interest, several noted that two GOP senators (Richard Burr of North Carolina and Tim Scott of South Carolina) recently introduced a child care bill, while their Republican colleague from Florida, Marco Rubio, has long promoted his own version of paid leave.",
            "But a common theme in those GOP proposals is a lack of new funding. Under Rubio’s proposal, for example, workers effectively pay for their own leave by giving up some of their future Social Security retirement benefits. “Absent real dollars, you’re just squeezing a balloon, where either the workers or the families or both are sacrificing,” said Melissa Boteach, vice president for income security and early learning/child care at the National Women’s Law Center.",
            "Not that Democrats are always so helpful. Pledges never to raise taxes on the middle class can preclude social insurance schemes that rely on small payroll contributions, which is how Social Security and Medicare work — and how paid leave programs in the states work.",
            "“I think the president’s tax pledge created huge problems for us,” Shabo said.",
            "What’s Next, And What’s After That",
            "All of that sounds like a lot of work ahead for the caregiving agenda’s champions — and it probably is. But they’ve also made a lot of progress already, coming within a few votes on Capitol Hill of enacting big pieces of their agenda.",
            "As recently as a few years ago, that would not have seemed possible.",
            "“Because of the countless families who shared their stories, Congress is finally paying attention to the caregiving crisis,” said Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), another leader in the crusade for a new, more comprehensive HCBS program. “For the first time, Democrats all agree we need to invest in home care for seniors and people with disabilities and the workers who care for them.”",
            "Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), who has spearheaded the child care campaign for years, has also seen the difference. When she first got to the Senate in 1993, she said, nobody on Capitol Hill wanted to discuss child care — even though she knew, as a working parent and former preschool teacher, how many families were already struggling.",
            "“It was a silent epidemic,” Murray told HuffPost.",
            "Now child care gets far more attention, Murray said. “We’ve broadened the conversation, created a real movement, developed a knowledge base. That gives you such a head start in politics.” At the same time, Murray added, whether that head start amounts to anything depends on picking up where this year’s legislative effort left off. “We can’t just vote on the last bill and call it a day,” she said.",
            "Of course, the caregiving agenda’s future will depend on one other, critical factor: whether a majority of lawmakers support and are willing to fight for it. The reality is that some version of the original caregiving proposals in Build Back Better might be law today if the House and Senate had even a handful of extra members who were committed to them.",
            "Rethinking policy, building coalitions, improving communications — all of that matters a lot. But ultimately success still depends on winning enough elections."

            "NIKOPOL, Ukraine (AP) — Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which hits the half-year mark this week, has already killed some 9,000 Ukrainian soldiers, a general said, and the fighting Monday showed no signs that the war is abating.",
            "At a veteran’s event, Ukraine’s military chief, Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said Ukraine’s children need to be taken care of because “their father went to the front line and, perhaps, is one of those almost 9,000 heroes who died.”",
            "In Nikopol, across the river from Ukraine’s main nuclear power plant, Russian shelling wounded four people Monday, an official said. The city on the Dnieper River has faced relentless pounding since July 12 that has damaged some 850 buildings and sent about half its population of 100,000 fleeing.",
            "The U.N. says 5,587 civilians have been killed and 7,890 injured in the Russian invasion of Ukraine that began on Feb. 24, although the estimate is likely conservative.",
            "“I feel hate towards Russians,” said 74-year-old Liudmyla Shyshkina, standing on the edge of her destroyed fourth-floor apartment in Nikopol that no longer has walls. She is still injured from the Aug. 10 blast that killed her 81-year-old husband, Anatoliy, on the spot.",
            "“The Second World War didn’t take away my father, but the Russian world did,” noted Pavlo Shyshkin, his son.",
            "U.S. President Joe Biden and the leaders of Britain, France and Germany had pleaded Sunday for Russia to end any military operation so close to to the Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant — Europe’s largest — but Nikopol came under fire three times overnight from rockets and mortar shells. Houses, a kindergarten, a bus station and stores were hit, authorities said.",
            "There are widespread fears that continued shelling and fighting in the area could lead to a nuclear catastrophe. Russia has asked for an urgent meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday to discuss the situation around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.",
            "Vladimir Rogov, an official with the Russia-installed administration of the Zaporizhzhia region, said Monday that because of the shelling, staffing at the nuclear plant has been cut, with only skeletal personnel remaining to maintain its operation.",
            "Monday’s announcement of the scope of Ukraine’s military dead stands in contrast to Russia’s military, which last gave an update on March 25 when it said 1,351 Russian troops were killed during the first month of fighting. U.S. military officials estimated two weeks ago that Russia has lost between 70,000 to 80,000 soldiers, both killed and wounded in action.",
            "On Monday though, Moscow turned its attention to one civilian death specifically.",
            "Russia blamed Ukrainian spy agencies for the car bombing on the outskirts of Moscow over the weekend that killed the daughter of a far-right Russian nationalist and ardent supporter of the invasion of Ukraine.",
            "Russia’s Federal Security Service, the main successor to the KGB, said Monday the killing was “prepared and perpetrated by the Ukrainian special services.” It charged that the bombing that killed 29-year-old TV commentator Darya Dugina, whose father, political theorist Alexander Dugin, is often referred to as “Putin’s brain,” was carried out by a Ukrainian citizen who left Russia for Estonia afterward.",
            "Ukrainian officials have vehemently denied any involvement in the car bombing.",
            "On the frontline, the Ukraine military said it carried out a strike on a key bridge over the Dnieper River in the Russian-occupied Kherson region. Local Russia-installed officials said it killed two people on Monday and wounded 16 others.",

The Russian-backed governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhaev, ordered that signs showing the location of bomb shelters be placed in the city, which had long seemed untouchable.",
            "Sevastopol, the Crimean port that is the home of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, has seen a series of drone attacks.

            "Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm on Sunday said the U.S. will produce a record amount of gasoline next year as the Biden administration continues its efforts to reduce prices for Americans.But Granholm warned that consumers could still be affected by events overseas.",
            "“As you know, gasoline comes from oil,” Granholm told “Fox News Sunday.” “Oil is traded on a global market. So we are at the whim, if you will, of what happens globally.”",
            "Granholm touted President Joe Biden’s actions to boost the domestic supply of gasoline. That includes releasing one million barrels of oil per day from the nation’s strategic reserves, which she called the “biggest tool at our disposal.”",
            "“This is all about supply and demand,” Granholm told Fox News’ Trace Gallagher. “When Russia invaded Ukraine, that pulled millions of barrels off of the global market. Since oil is traded globally, we have to make up for that lost amount of fuel.”The U.S. will produce a record amount of oil — 12.7 million barrels per day — by next year, she said. The previous record was 12.2 barrels per day, according to The Hill.Gas prices started increasing in mid-2020 as the world adjusted to COVID, and went back up this year following Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine as Western countries sanctioned Russian oil, according to The Associated Press. Russia is one of the world’s biggest oil producers.In early August, prices fell below $4 for the first time in five months, due to fears of a global recession, AP reported.The Energy Information Administration expects that by the fourth quarter of this year, gas prices will fall to $3.78 on average from the current $3.90 on average, Granholm said.",
            "“They’ve fallen every single day of this summer,” Granholm said of gas prices. “We’re hopeful that that will continue.”",

            "“If China opens up significantly after COVID, there will be more pressure on demand,” Granholm said. “More pressure on demand means upward pressure on prices. So we’re watching what happens globally. But we are doing everything possible to try to stabilize supply and demand to keep those prices coming down.”",
            "Granholm also spoke about how incentives included in the “Inflation Reduction Act” — the Democrats’ climate and health care law signed by Biden last week — could help the U.S. become energy independent by creating its own supply chain and energy ecosystem.",

            "“He wants to re-shore manufacturing,” Granholm added. “It’s not just in electric vehicles, this Inflation Reduction Act provides credits to businesses to incentivize them to re-shore in America.”",
            "Pressed on whether clean energy sources, including solar and wind, are reliable, Granholm argued that the Democratic bill would help the U.S. fully take advantage of technology to enable that transition.",

            "ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistani police have filed terrorism charges against former Prime Minister Imran Khan, authorities said Monday, escalating political tensions in the country as the ousted premier holds mass rallies seeking to return to office.",
            "The charges followed a speech Khan gave in Islamabad on Saturday in which he vowed to sue police officers and a female judge and alleged that a close aide had been tortured after his arrest.",
            "Khan himself has not publicly spoken about the latest charges against him. However, a court in Islamabad issued a so-called “protective bail” for Khan for the next three days, preventing police from arresting him over the charges, said Shah Mahmood Qureshi, a senior leader in his Tehreek-e-Insaf opposition party.",
            "Hundreds of Tehreek-e-Insaf members stood outside Khan’s home on Monday in a show of support as the former premier held meetings inside. The party has warned that it will hold nationwide rallies if Khan is arrested while working to try to squash the charges in court.",
            "Under Pakistan’s legal system, police file what is known as a first information report about charges against an accused person to a magistrate judge, who allows the investigation to move forward. Typically, police then arrest and question the accused.",
            "The report against Khan includes testimony from Magistrate Judge Ali Javed, who described being at the Islamabad rally on Saturday and hearing Khan criticize the inspector-general of Pakistan’s police and another judge. Khan went on to reportedly say: “You also get ready for it, we will also take action against you. All of you must be ashamed.”",
            "Khan could face several years in prison from the new charges, which accuse him of threatening police officers and the judge under the country’s sedition act, which stems from British colonial-era law. However, he’s not been detained on other lesser charges levied against him in his recent campaigning against the government.",
            "The Pakistani judiciary also has a history of politicization and taking sides in power struggles between the military, the civilian government and opposition politicians, according to the Washington-based advocacy group Freedom House. Current Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif likely will discuss the charges against Khan at a Cabinet meeting scheduled for Tuesday.",
            "Khan came to power in 2018, promising to break the pattern of family rule in Pakistan. His opponents contend he was elected with help from the powerful military, which has ruled the country for half of its 75-year history.",
            "In seeking Khan’s ouster earlier this year, the opposition had accused him of economic mismanagement as inflation soars and the Pakistani rupee plummets in value. The parliament’s no-confidence vote in April that ousted Khan capped months of political turmoil and a constitutional crisis that required the Supreme Court to step in. Meanwhile, it appeared the military similarly had cooled to Khan.",
            "Khan alleged without providing evidence that the Pakistani military took part in a U.S. plot to oust him. Washington, the Pakistani military and Sharif’s government have all denied the allegation. Meanwhile, Khan has been carrying out a series of mass rallies trying to pressure the government.",
            "In his latest speech Sunday night at a rally in the city of Rawalpindi outside of Islamabad, Khan said so-called “neutrals” were behind the recent crackdown against his party. He has in the past used the phrase “neutrals” for the military.",
            "“A plan has been made to place our party against the wall. I assure you, that the Sri Lankan situation is going to happen here,” Khan threatened, referencing the recent economic protests that toppled that island nation’s government.",
            "“Now we are following law and constitution. But when a political party strays from that path, the situation inside Pakistan, who will stop the public? There are 220 million people.”",
            "Khan’s party has been holding mass protests, but Pakistan’s government and security forces fear the former cricket star’s popularity still could draw millions out to the street. That could further pressure the nuclear-armed nation as it struggles to secure a $7 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund amid an economic crisis, exacerbated by rising global food prices due in part by Russia’s war on Ukraine.",
            "On Sunday, the internet-access advocacy group NetBlocks said internet services in the country blocked access to YouTube after Khan broadcast the speech on the platform despite a ban issued by the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority.",
            "Police arrested Khan’s political aide, Shahbaz Gill, earlier this month after he appeared on the private television channel ARY TV and urged soldiers and officers to refuse to obey “illegal orders” from the military leadership. Gill was charged with treason, which under Pakistani law carries the death penalty. ARY also remains off-air in Pakistan following that broadcast.",
            "Khan has alleged that police abused Gill while in custody. Police say Gill suffers from asthma and has not been abused while detained.",
            "Gill was discharged from a hospital to attend a court hearing Monday on whether he should return to jail. Gill appeared healthy in television footage as he left for the court amid tight security",
            "Khan’s speech Saturday in Islamabad focused primarily on Gill’s arrest.",

            "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — When Minneapolis teachers settled a 14-day strike in March, they celebrated a groundbreaking provision in their new contract that was meant to shield teachers of color from seniority-based layoffs and help ensure that students from racial minorities have teachers who look like them.",
            "Months later, conservative media outlets have erupted with denunciations of the policy as racist and unconstitutional discrimination against white educators. One legal group is looking to recruit teachers and taxpayers willing to sue to throw out the language. The teachers union paints the dispute as a ginned-up controversy when there’s no imminent danger of anyone losing their job. Meanwhile, the feud is unfolding just months ahead of arguments in a pair of U.S. Supreme Court cases that could reshape affirmative action.",
            "“The same people who want to take down teachers unions and blame seniority are now defending it for white people,” said Greta Callahan, president of the teachers unit at the Minneapolis Federation of Teachers. “This is all made up by the right wing now. And we could not be more proud of this language.”",
            "Recent coverage in conservative platforms such as the local news website Alpha News, Fox News nationally and the Daily Mail internationally sparked criticisms from prominent figures, including Donald Trump Jr. and former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who curbed the power of public employee unions in his state. Walker on Twitter called it “another example of why government unions should be eliminated.”",
            "The contract language doesn’t specifically say that white teachers would be laid off ahead of teachers of color, though critics say that’s what the effect would be. The contract exempts “teachers who are members of populations underrepresented among licensed teachers in the District,” as well as alumni of historically Black and Hispanic colleges, and of tribal colleges. Around 60% of the district’s teachers are white, while more than 60% of the students are from racial minorities.",
            "Advocates say students from racial minorities perform better when their educators include teachers and support staff of color, and that it’s especially critical in a district that suffers from stubborn achievement gaps. Callahan said her union fought for years to get the protection added to their contract, and that she knows of two other Minnesota districts with similar provisions.",
            "Minneapolis is one of many districts across the U.S. struggling with declining teacher headcounts and tight budgets. But Callahan disputed that the provision threatens anyone’s job, noting that Minneapolis has nearly 300 unfilled positions as teachers and students prepare to go back to school, and the language won’t take effect until the 2023 academic year.",
            "Callahan called it “just one teensy, tiny step towards equity” that doesn’t begin to make up for many teachers of color quitting the district in recent years because they felt underpaid and disrespected.",
            "To Lindsey West, a fifth grade teacher at Clara Barton Community School who identifies as Black and Indigenous, the seniority language is one piece of a bigger mission of improving education.",
            "West said she feels strongly that students of color benefit from having teachers that look like them, but said she’s also seen that diversity can be empowering for white students. She said she’s sometimes been the first educator of color that Black or white students have had.",
            "“We want to have kids from all demographics having experiences with people of different backgrounds and different cultures, and becoming aware that our shared humanity is what’s important, and not the things that divide us,” West said.",
            "Minneapolis Public Schools interim Superintendent Rochelle Cox declined a request for an interview.",
            "“The object of this provision is clearly to lay off white teachers first, regardless of merit, based on the color of their skin, and that is a big problem under the Constitution and the 14th Amendment,” said James Dickey, senior trial counsel at the Upper Midwest Law Center, a conservative nonprofit that often takes on public employee unions. It has brought litigation over such issues as COVID-19 mask mandates and displays of Black Lives Matter posters.",
            "Dickey said his group is considering suing and has had a flood of Minneapolis taxpayers — and some teachers — contact them to say they are “offended that my tax dollars could go to fund this kind of racist agenda.”",
            "He argued that a 1986 U.S. Supreme Court decision known as the Wygant case bars such provisions and would serve as a precedent in Minnesota.",
            "The Wygant case involved a teachers contract in Jackson, Michigan, which took a different approach from the Minneapolis agreement. It effectively said Jackson could not make cuts that led to an overall reduction in the percentage of minority personnel employed in the district. White teachers sued after being laid off while some teachers of color with less seniority kept their jobs. A divided Supreme Court held that the layoffs violated the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution.",
            "Andrew Crook, spokesman for the American Federation of Teachers, said he didn’t know of anything similar to the Minneapolis wording in contracts in other states, though he said some contracts provide exceptions from straight seniority rules for teachers in hard-to-fill specialties such as math and special education.",
            "Officials with other national public employee unions and professional associations either said they didn’t know of anything similar in their fields or did not respond to requests for comment.",
            "Two affirmative action cases set for oral arguments before the Supreme Court in October, involving Harvard University and the University of North Carolina, could have a bearing on the Minneapolis dispute. The cases are challenges to the consideration of race in college admission decisions.",
            "Affirmative action has been reviewed by the high court several times over the past 40 years and has generally been upheld, but with limits. With three new conservative justices on the court since its last review, however, the practice may be facing its greatest threat yet.",
            "Joseph Daly, a professor emeritus at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law who arbitrates disputes across the country, including many teacher cases over the years, said the Minneapolis language appears designed to survive a court challenge.",
            "“The U.S. Supreme Court in the past has OK’d affirmative action when there were very valid objectives to be achieved in ultimately seeking equality for all human beings,” Daly said. “Now the question of today is: Will this concept be upheld by the courts in light of the more conservative stance on the Supreme Court? I don’t have an answer on that.”"

            "HONOLULU (AP) — For more than 50 years, telescopes and the needs of astronomers have dominated the summit of Mauna Kea, a mountain sacred to Native Hawaiians that’s also one of the finest places in the world to study the night sky.",
            "That’s now changing with a new state law saying Mauna Kea must be protected for future generations and that science must be balanced with culture and the environment. Native Hawaiian cultural experts will have voting seats on a new governing body, instead of merely advising the summit’s managers as they do now.",
            "The shift comes after thousands of protesters camped on the mountain three years ago to block the construction of a state-of-the-art observatory, jolting policymakers and astronomers into realizing the status quo had to change.",
            "There’s a lot at stake: Native Hawaiian advocates want to protect a site of great spiritual importance. Astronomers hope they’ll be able to renew leases for state land underneath their observatories, due to expire in 11 years, and continue making revolutionary scientific discoveries for decades to come. Business and political leaders are eager for astronomy to support well-paying jobs in a state that has long struggled to diversify its tourism-dependent economy.",
            "To top if off, the new authority may offer a first-in-the-world test case for whether astronomers can find a way to respectfully and responsibly study the universe from Indigenous and culturally significant lands.",
            "“We’ve been here for centuries. We are not gone; we are still here. And we have knowledge that would produce a feasible management solution that would be more inclusive,” said Shane Palacat-Nelson, a Native Hawaiian who helped draft a report that laid the foundation for the new law.",
            "At issue is the summit of Mauna Kea, which sits 13,803 feet (4,207 meters) above sea level. In 1968, the state gave the University of Hawaii a 65-year lease for land that the school subleases to leading global research institutions in exchange for a share of observation time.",
            "Astronomers like Mauna Kea’s summit because its clear skies, dry air and limited light pollution make it the best place to study space from the Northern Hemisphere. Its dozen huge telescopes have played key roles in advancing humanity’s understanding of the universe, including making some of the first images of planets outside our solar system. Astronomer Andrea Ghez used one to prove the existence of a supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy, for which she shared the 2020 Nobel Prize in physics.",
            "But the telescopes have also changed the summit landscape and have increasingly upset Native Hawaiians who view the place as sacred. The 2019 protests by people calling themselves “kia’i,” or protectors of the mountain, were aimed at stopping the construction of the biggest and most advanced observatory yet: The $2.65 billion Thirty Meter Telescope, or TMT, backed by the University of California and other institutions.",
            "Law enforcement arrested 38 elders, mostly Native Hawaiians, which only attracted more protesters. Police withdrew months later after TMT said it wouldn’t move forward with construction right away. Protesters stayed put but closed camp in March 2020 amid concerns about COVID-19.",
            "The episode pushed lawmakers to seek a new approach.",
            "The result is the new governing body, the Mauna Kea Stewardship and Oversight Authority, which will have a board of 11 voting members. The governor will appoint eight. Gov. David Ige hasn’t set a date for announcing his nominees, who will go before the state Senate for confirmation. He said more than 30 have applied.",
            "Palacat-Nelsen said traditional Native Hawaiian knowledge could help the authority determine how large a footprint manmade structures like telescopes should have at the summit.",
            "“Do we take heavy steps? Do we take light steps? When do we take steps? What seasons do we take steps?” Palacat-Nelsen said. “All that type of knowledge is embedded in the majority of our stories, our traditional stories that were handed down.”",
            "The board will have this expertise because one member of the authority must be a recognized practitioner of Native Hawaiian culture and another a direct descendant of a Native Hawaiian practitioner of Mauna Kea traditions.",
            "Central to the Native Hawaiian view of Mauna Kea is the idea that the summit is where gods dwell and humans aren’t allowed to live. A centuries-old chant says the mountain is the oldest child of Wakea and Papawalinu’u, the male and female sources of all life. To this day, the mountain draws clouds and rainfall that feeds forests and fresh water to communities on Hawaii’s Big Island.",
            "Lawmakers drafted the law after a working group of Native Hawaiian cultural experts, protesters, observatory workers and state officials met to discuss Mauna Kea. Their report, which dedicated a large chunk to the historical and cultural significance of the mountain, formed the foundation of the new law.",
            "Several kia’i who served on that working group support the authority. The House speaker has nominated one kia’i leader for the board.",
            "But some longtime telescope opponents are critical, creating questions about how broad the authority’s community support will be.Kealoha Pisciotta, who has been part of legal challenges against TMT and other observatory proposals since 1998, said Native Hawaiians should at minimum have an equal standing on the board.“You don’t have a real say. It’s designed to create an illusion of having consent and representation in a situation where we really don’t,” said Pisciotta, a spokesperson for the groups Mauna Kea Hui and Mauna Kea Aina Hou.Lawmakers said the pressure to address Hawaii’s telescope standoff isn’t just coming from within the state but also from the U.S. astronomy community.State Rep. David Tarnas pointed to a report by a committee of astronomers from across the country declaring there’s a need to develop a new model of collaborative decision-making together with Indigenous and local communities.“This is not just the Big Island issue, it’s not just a state issue, but I believe it’s a global issue,” said state Sen. Donna Mercado Kim. “I believe that the world is watching to see how we deal with this.”The TMT matter, meanwhile, remains unresolved: Its backers still want to build on Mauna Kea, though they have selected a site in Spain’s Canary Islands as a backup.The head of the University of Hawaii’s astronomy program said the authority could help his own institution if it “stabilizes the whole situation” for Mauna Kea astronomy.But Doug Simons said he’s worried the authority might not get up and running in time to renew the summit master lease and subleases.The master lease requires that all existing telescopes be decommissioned and their sites restored to their original state by 2033 if the state doesn’t authorize an extension.Simons said it will take at least five or six years to dismantle the telescopes and associated infrastructure. That means new lease arrangements must be ready by 2027 or the observatories will have to begin winding down.“There’s no obvious way around this,” Simons said. He said he’s pressing for the authority to be established as soon as possible to maximize time for negotiations and inevitable legal challenges.Rich Matsuda, who works for W.M. Keck Observatory and served on the working group, urged the eventual board members to avoid being “stakeholders with narrow interests just trying to ensure that they get their piece of the pie.”Tensions over telescope construction, he said, caused people to lock down and avoid discussing difficult issues surrounding Mauna Kea. The new law’s prioritization of the mountain’s well being may alter that, he said.“My hope is that this gives us a chance, if we do it right, to change that, dynamic, Matsuda said."

            "Leon Vitali, the “Barry Lyndon” actor who became one of Stanley Kubrick’s closest associates, has died. He was 74.",
            "Vitali died Friday in Los Angeles, his family told The Associated Press Sunday. He passed peacefully surrounded by loved ones including his three children, Masha, Max and Vera.",
            "“Leon was a special and lovely man driven by his curiosity, who spread love and warmth wherever he went,” his children said in a statement provided by Masha Vitali. “He will be remembered with love and be hugely missed by the many people he touched.”",
            "Though Vitali was often described as Kubrick’s assistant, Tony Zierra’s 2017 documentary “ Filmworker ” shed light on Vitali’s enormous and largely unsung contributions to the work of one of cinema’s greatest figures from “The Shining” through “Eyes Wide Shut.” He did everything from casting and coaching actors to overseeing restorations. Vitali even once set up a video monitor so that Kubrick could keep an eye on his dying cat.",
            "Matthew Modine, who starred in Kubrick’s “Full Metal Jacket,” tweeted his condolences Sunday.",
            "“There are people we meet who have a profound impact upon our lives. Leon Vitali was one such person in mine,” Modine wrote. “An artist in every aspect of his life. A loving father & friend to so many. A kind, generous & forgiving nature. He exemplified & personified grace.”",
            "Filmmaker Lee Unkrich also tweeted that he was, “Completely heartbroken to hear about the passing of Leon Vitali. He helped me (asterisk)enormously(asterisk) with my Shining book and I’m gutted that he won’t see it. He was a sweet, kind, humble, generous man and a vital part of Stanley Kubrick’s team.”",
            "Before meeting Kubrick, Vitali was a rising actor in England, appearing in several British television shows including “Softly, Softly,” “Follyfoot,” “Z Cars” and “Notorious Woman.” Then in 1974 he got his biggest break yet, when he was cast in “Barry Lyndon” as Lord Bullingdon, the son-in-law of Ryan O’Neal’s title character.",
            "Vitali was so fascinated by Kubrick and his processes that he made an unusual decision: He gave up on acting and devoted himself entirely to the famously demanding director for over two decades. His next Kubrick credit was as “personal assistant to the director” on “The Shining,” though that’s only part of the story — Vitali famously helped cast 4-year-old Danny Lloyd to play Danny Torrance and Louise and Lisa Burns as the creepy Grady twins (citing Diane Arbus as inspiration).",
            "“I made one truly, truly radical change in my life and that was when I said, ‘I’m more interested in that’ than I was in the acting,” Vitali told the Associated Press in 2017. “That’s the biggest conscious decision I’ve ever made. There were some sacrifices, but there were gains too.”",
            "After Kubrick’s death in 1999, Vitali oversaw restorations for many of Kubrick’s films. He received a Cinema Audio Society award for his work. Vitali later worked with director Todd Field on his films “Little Children” and “In the Bedroom.”",
            "Before making the documentary, Zierra said that he and many Kubrick-obsessed fans knew Vitali for his performances in “Barry Lyndon” and “Eyes Wide Shut,” in which he played Red Cloak, and as a key member of Kubrick’s inner circle. But when they finally met Vitali to make the film, they were struck by “his kindness, humility and the fascinating scope of his story.”",
            "Zierra is working on a director’s cut of “Filmworker” that will include new footage that he and Vitali wanted in the film, but couldn’t get done in time for its Cannes debut in 2017."

            "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — The prosecution spent three weeks telling jurors how Nikolas Cruz murdered 14 students and three staff members at a Florida high school four years ago. Now his attorneys will get their chance to present why they believe he did it, hoping to get him sentenced to life without parole instead of death.",
            "Melisa McNeill, Cruz’s lead public defender, is expected to give her opening statement Monday, having deferred its presentation from the start of the trial a month ago.",
            "She and her team will then begin laying out their 23-year-old client’s life history: his birth mother’s abuse of alcohol and cocaine during her pregnancy, leading to possible fetal alcohol syndrome; his severe mental and emotional problems; his alleged sexual abuse by a “trusted peer;” the bullying he endured; and his adoptive father’s death when he was 5 and his adoptive mother’s four months before his Feb. 14, 2018, attack at Parkland’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.",
            "McNeill’s decision to delay her opening statement appeared part of a broader strategy to not deny or lessen anything prosecutors told jurors about Cruz’s massacre — he pleaded guilty in October to 17 counts of first-degree murder. This trial is only to decide his sentence; the seven-man, five woman jury will consider whether the prosecution’s aggravating circumstances “outweigh” the defense’s mitigating factors.",
            "The defense is “going to say, ‘Look, you saw what happened — we are not going to argue that. It was horrible, that was awful, that was horrific, whatever adjectives you want to use,” said David S. Weinstein, a Miami defense attorney and former prosecutor. But then the defense will add: “He never had a chance and, because of that, his poor victims never had a chance.’”",
            "This is the deadliest U.S. mass shooting to ever reach trial. Nine other gunmen who killed at least 17 people died during or immediately after their shootings, either by suicide or police gunfire. The suspect in the 2019 slaying of 23 people at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, is awaiting trial.",
            "During the prosecution’s case, McNeill’s team never cross-examined any teacher or student who witnessed the slayings and only had brief, mild exchanges with a few other witnesses.",
            "They asked one teacher from a classroom where no one was shot about the lack of a security monitor in the three-story building where the slayings happened. When the gun store owner who sold Cruz the AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle used in the killings testified, they asked what Florida’s minimum age was in 2017 to buy a rifle — 18 — and today — 21.",
            "Neither they nor the prosecutors then asked the store owner why the law was changed: Cruz was 19 when the shooting happened and the Republican-led Legislature raised the age limit as part of a larger package of gun laws enacted in response to the shootings.",
            "Cruz’s youth will be part of his defense and while Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer has barred the defense from presenting testimony that directly casts blame on third parties like school administrators for not preventing the shooting, McNeill and her team will likely try to indirectly make such points.",
            "To get Cruz a life sentence, the defense will only have to persuade one of the 12 jurors, but they will have to do it on all 17 counts, one for each victim. It is possible, for example, a reluctant juror might be pushed to vote for death on victims who surveillance video showed Cruz shot multiple times as they lay wounded and helpless.",
            "The defense will be trying to overcome the horrendous evidence that was laid out by the prosecution, capped by the jurors’ Aug. 4 visit to the fenced-off building that Cruz stalked for seven minutes, firing about 150 shots down halls and into classrooms. The jurors saw dried blood on floors and walls, bullet holes in doors and windows and remnants of Valentine’s Day balloons, flowers and cards.",
            "Prosecutors also presented graphic surveillance videos of the massacre; gruesome crime scene and autopsy photos from its aftermath; emotional testimony from teachers and students who witnessed others die; and four days of tearful and angry statements from parents, spouses and other family members about the victims and how their loved one’s death affected their lives. Jurors also watched video of Cruz calmly ordering a cherry and blue raspberry Icee minutes after the shooting and, nine months later, attacking a jail guard.",
            "It is unknown how long the defense presentation will take, but they said in court recently that it will last past Labor Day in two weeks. The prosecution will then get to present a rebuttal case before it goes to the jury."

            "ATLANTA (AP) — A judge has declined to block a section of a Georgia election law that bans handing out food and water to voters waiting in line.",
            "The provision is part of a sweeping elections overhaul passed by Georgia lawmakers last year. Voting rights groups, who have filed a lawsuit challenging multiple parts of the law, argued that the provision infringes their free speech rights and should be immediately blocked while the case is pending.",
            "The 74-page order, which was issued Thursday, means that the provision will remain in effect for the closely watched November general election. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp is locked in a rematch with Democratic challenger Stacey Abrams, while Democratic U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock is trying to fend off a challenge from Republican Herschel Walker.",
            "The state had argued that the provision was necessary to protect against conditions at polling places that could raise worries over potential illegal campaigning or vote buying. State lawyers also argued it was too close to the upcoming election to make changes.",
            "U.S. District Judge J.P. Boulee said the voting rights groups may ultimately prevail on part of their challenge, but he agreed with the state that it’s too close to the election to block any part of the provision. He noted that requiring different rules for the general election than those in place for the primaries earlier this year could cause confusion for election workers.",
            "Boulee said that voting rights groups had failed to show that prohibiting the distribution of food and drinks within 150 feet (45 meters) of a polling place violates their constitutional rights. But he said that another part of the provision that bars people from offering food and drink within 25 feet (7.6 meters) of any person in line is probably unconstitutional because that zone is tied to the location of voters and could stretch thousands of feet from the polling place.",
            "The voting rights groups expressed disappointment with Boulee’s ruling but said they will continue to fight.",
            "“While Georgia’s cruel ban on line relief stands for now, we look forward to presenting our broader case against SB 202 at trial, where we will prove that many provisions in the legislation violate federal law and the Constitution,” said ACLU of Georgia voting rights attorney Rahul Garabadu.",
            "Republicans have said high turnout and short lines in this year’s primary elections show that the new law doesn’t discourage or restrict voting. But critics say it disproportionately affects marginalized voters, and many Democrats have pledged to roll it back.",

            "The longtime political activist died on Aug. 12, the Seattle Times reported. Her daughter, Gabriele Rainey, told the newspaper her mom was “so active because she loved this country, and she wanted to make sure that the country was good to its people.”",
            "Rainey was a fixture in the local progressive movement for decades, demonstrating for racial justice, affordable housing and public transit, and against war, nuclear weapons and big banks.",
            "In November 2011, in the early days of the Occupy Wall Street movement, Rainey, then 84, joined protesters in blocking downtown intersections. She was hit when Seattle police used pepper spray to clear the crowd.",
            "Fellow protesters poured milk over her face to ease the sting, and a seattlepi.com photographer, Joshua Trujillo, captured a stunning image of her staring defiantly into the camera, her eyes red and milk dripping off her face.",
            "The photo become a worldwide symbol for the protest movement. She was profiled by The Washington Post, The Atlantic, The Associated Press and The Guardian.",
            "“It’s a gruesome picture,” she told the AP. “I’m really not that bad looking.”",
            "Then-Mayor Mike McGinn apologized and ordered a review of the incident. Rainey was back out protesting a couple days later.",
            "“Dorli is legendary, and deservedly so, for her activism,” McGinn said Friday. “She was just omnipresent and a conscience and a voice for change, and I deeply, deeply, deeply respected her.”",
            "Rainey was born in Austria in 1926. She was a Red Cross nurse and then worked in Europe as a technical translator for the U.S. Army for 10 years. She married Max Rainey, a civil engineer who got a job with Boeing, and they moved to the Seattle area in 1956.",

            "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Former Vice President Mike Pence said Friday that he didn’t take any classified information with him when he left office.",
            "The disclosure — which would typically be unremarkable for a former vice president — is notable given that FBI agents seized classified and top secret information from his former boss’s Florida estate on Aug. 8 while investigating potential violations of three different federal laws. Former President Donald Trump has claimed that the documents seized by agents were “all declassified.”",
            "Pence, asked directly if he had retained any classified information upon leaving office, told The Associated Press in an interview, “No, not to my knowledge.”",
            "Despite the inclusion of material marked “top secret” in the government’s list of items recovered from Mar-a-Lago, Pence said, “I honestly don’t want to prejudge it before until we know all the facts.”",
            "Pence was in Iowa on Friday as part of a two day-trip to the state, which hosts the leadoff Republican presidential caucuses. It comes as the former vice president has made stops in other early voting states as he takes steps toward mounting a 2024 White House campaign.",
            "Pence also weighed in on Republican U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney’s primary defeat earlier in the week to a rival backed by Trump. Cheney, who is arguably Trump’s most prominent Republican critic, has called the former president “a very grave threat and risk to our republic” and further raised his ire through her role as vice chair of the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.",
            "“My reaction was, the people of Wyoming have spoken,” said Pence, who was targeted at the Capitol that day by angry rioters, including some who chanted, “Hang Mike Pence!” “And, you know, I accept their judgment about the kind of representation they want on Capitol Hill.”",
            "Pence said he has “great respect” for Cheney’s father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who served two terms under President George W. Bush.",
            "“And I appreciate the conservative stance Congresswoman Cheney has taken over the years,” Pence continued. “But I’ve been disappointed in the partisan taint of the Jan. 6 committee from early on.”",
            "Pence’s aides said the committee contacted his legal team months ago to see if he would be willing to testify. Although Pence has said he would give “due consideration” to cooperating, he was adamant that the historic nature of such participation must be warranted and agreed upon.",
            "“Beyond my concerns about the partisan nature of the Jan. 6 committee, there are profound constitutional issues that have to be considered,” he said. “No vice president has ever been summoned to testify before the Congress of the United States.”",
            "Speaking further about the search of Mar-a-Lago, the former vice president raised the possibility, as he has previously, that the investigation was politically motivated and called on Attorney General Merrick Garland to disclose more details on what led authorities to conduct the search.",
            "“The concern that millions of Americans felt is only going to be resolved with daylight,” Pence said Friday. “I know that’s not customary in an investigation. But this is unprecedented action by the Justice Department, and I think it merits an unprecedented transparency.”",
            "The Jan. 6 insurrection marked the first in a number of public breaks between Trump and his once devout No. 2. But Pence has been careful not to alienate Republicans who have supported Trump but might be looking for another candidate in the 2024 election. Despite his reluctance to criticize the former president, Pence has occasionally spoken out against Trump, criticizing the attack at the U.S. Capitol and more recently urging his fellow Republicans to stop lashing out at the FBI over the search of Mar-a-Lago.",
            "“The Republican Party is the party of law and order,” Pence said Wednesday at a political breakfast in New Hampshire. “Our party stands with the men and women who stand on the thin blue line at the federal and state and local level, and these attacks on the FBI must stop.”",
            "Pence said Friday that he would make a decision early next year about whether to run for the White House, a move that his aides have said will be independent of what Trump decides to do.",
            "Having visited the Iowa State Fair on Friday afternoon, Pence also headlined a fundraiser earlier in the day for Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley and was scheduled to speak to a Christian conservative group and a northern Iowa county Republican Party fundraiser before leaving Saturday."

            "Drone pilot Matt Ross was filming Juan Carlos La Verde, a firefighter and paramedic, when La Verde suddenly felt a 12-foot gator “pierce” his skin and make his head “pop,” per Creative Loafing Tampa Bay.",
            "La Verde, 34, was swimming in Lake Thonotosassa in suburban Tampa during filming of an instructional video for DefeatX, an organization that aims to help people dealing with anxiety and depression through athletic endeavors. Ross’ drone captured the attack on camera.",
            "Watch the encounter below:",
            "Creative Loafing Tampa Bay reported that the alligator closed its mouth with a total pressure of around 2,000 pounds on La Verde’s head and chest. The bite was enough to crush a portion of La Verde’s skull and break his jaw.",
            "In an interview with WFTS-TV, La Verde, a former U.S. Air Force pararescueman, recalled the moment he knew he was under attack.",
            "“With the right stroke, all I felt was scales, teeth and then right there I’m like okay. So, what I think I did, what I felt like I did, was that I immediately tried to open its jaws because I knew I was in a gator,” La Verde said. “When I felt the teeth, I immediately knew, and then as I opened it I knew that I either turned it or it turned me, but it was confused just as I was confused, and then it just let go.”",
            "According to Creative Loafing Tampa Bay, it was the 18th attack by an alligator this year.",

            "Ross, who unknowingly captured the attack from above, said he couldn’t believe La Verde survived the encounter.",
            "“It’s both a tragedy and a miracle at the same time,” Ross told Creative Loafing Tampa Bay.",

            "However, La Verde is still looking up despite the scary encounter.",
            "“I am perfectly fine. I am actually even better because this gave me a new perspective, you know, and not many people get that,” La Verde told WFTS-TV. “Find your God. Find him. It’s silly. I get that that’s scary, I do, but life is a scary place, so you can carry that load by yourself or have someone carry it for you.”"

            "Experiencing chest pain is scary and shouldn’t be ignored. At best, it’s uncomfortable; at worst, it’s a concerning warning sign. Chest pain is also fairly common: Non-traumatic chest pain is the second-most frequent cause of emergency department visits among adults, accounting for as many as 8 million visits a year, according to a 2016 study in JAMA Internal Medicine.",
            "With so many potential causes of chest pain (which we’ll get into in a bit), how do you know what you’re dealing with? Is it heart-related pain or something else?",
            "As someone who has struggled with chest pain on and off for years, with a few guesses at the culprit — anxiety, asthma, costochondritis — I know, to some degree, what that fear is like. I reached out to cardiologists for their input on what to look for.",
            "When chest pain might be a heart issue",
            "One thing to monitor is when the pain arises.",
            "“Chest discomfort that is heart-related is usually described as a chest discomfort that is worse with exertion,” said Dr. Estelle Jean, a cardiologist from MedStar Montgomery Medical Center in Olney, Maryland. “Patients typically describe the chest discomfort as tightness, pressure, heaviness, squeezing, a band-like sensation or heartburn.” She added the pain is usually gradual in both the onset and offset.",
            "If the chest pain is secondary to blockages of heart arteries, you may also notice other signs. For example, the pain “may radiate to the left arm, shoulder or jaw, and can be associated with other symptoms such as trouble breathing, lightheadedness, sweating or nausea and vomiting,” said Dr. Adriana Quinones-Camacho, a cardiologist and the chief of medicine at NYU Langone Health’s Manhattan campus.",
            "Both Jean and Quinones-Camacho agreed that rest is crucial — along with talking to a doctor, of course. “Any chest pain symptoms should be taken very seriously and fully evaluated by a health care provider,” Quinones-Camacho said.",
            "What are other causes of chest pain, and what can relieve them?",
            "Let’s start with what chest pain that’s not related to the heart usually looks like. Jean said it’s “typically described as a sharp pain that is worse with deep breathing or coughing, pain localized with one finger, pain worse with movement or palpation, and fleeting pains lasting a few seconds or less.”",
            "Many things can cause chest pain, but here are some of the common ones experts see:",
            "Acid reflux",
            "Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or acid reflux, is when stomach acid comes back up your esophagus. (Yup, it’s as bad as it sounds.) You may notice heartburn after eating, difficulty swallowing and coughing. Jean suggested treating GERD with antacids, such as Tums or Rolaids.",
            "Asthma",
            "Asthma is a condition where your airways narrow and produce extra mucus. Signs include wheezing while exhaling, shortness of breath and coughing. If you have asthma, talk to your doctor about getting an inhaler if you don’t already have one (and make sure you get a new one once your current one expires).",
            "Anxiety",
            "Like many mental illnesses, anxiety can cause physical issues, such as chest pain. Besides worrying, people with generalized anxiety disorder may also overthink, struggle with uncertainty and be unable to relax or concentrate. Both psychotherapy and anti-anxiety medication can help, Jean said.",
            "“Strategies to reduce stress can include meditation, yoga, sleeping at least 7 to 8 hours at night, eating a heart-healthy diet and engaging in regular exercise,” she added. Heart-healthy foods that cardiologists eat include fruit, vegetables, lean meat and whole grains.",
            "Muscle strain",
            "Skipping warm-ups before exercising, contact injuries, lifting things while twisting your body and muscle fatigue can all cause muscle strain.",
            "Pay attention to any bruising, pain while breathing, swelling and difficulty moving. If you faint, get dizzy, vomit, have a fever, get sleepy or struggle to breathe after, go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, Quinones-Camacho said the issue should resolve on its own.",
            "Among the other potential causes of chest pain are chest wall issues, stomach ulcers, a pulmonary embolism and pneumonia. Getting your doctor’s input on your specific case is important. At the very least, consider calling a nurse support line. Insurance companies often offer this as part of their benefits.",
            "Remember: Chest pain can be life-threatening, even if it doesn’t seem like it at first. Seeing a physician as soon as possible is vital."

            "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Vanessa Bryant testified Friday that she only beginning to grieve the loss of her husband basketball star Kobe Bryant and their 13-year-old daughter Gianna when she was faced with the fresh horror of learning that sheriff’s deputies and firefighters had shot and shared photos of their bodies at the site of the helicopter crash that killed them.",
            "“I felt like I wanted to run, run down the block and scream,” she said, her tears turning to sobs and her voice quickening. “It was like the feeling of wanting to run down a pier and jump into the water. The problem is I can’t escape. I can’t escape my body.”",
            "During her three hours on the witness stand in a Los Angeles federal court, where she is suing LA County for invasion of privacy over the pictures, Bryant said she had fought to get through both public and private memorials for her loved ones and seven others who were killed Jan. 26, 2020, and thought she was ready to really begin the grieving process about a month later. She was with friends and her surviving daughters, and holding her 7-month-old baby, when she received a call about a Los Angeles Times story on the crash-site photos.",
            "“I bolted out of the house and around to the side so my girls wouldn’t see,” she said. “I was blindsided again, devastated, hurt. I trusted them. I trusted them not to do these things.”",
            "Evidence presented at trial showed that a sheriff’s deputy showed a photo of Bryant’s body to a bartender as he drank, spurring an official complaint from another man drinking nearby, and that firefighters shared them with each other at an awards banquet. Others shared them with spouses. An attorney for the county said the photos had been taken only because they were essential for assessing the site moments after the crash, and that when LA County Sheriff Alex Villanueva learned they were being shared, he demanded they all be deleted.",
            "No photos emerged publicly, but Vanessa Bryant said she has constant worry that some still might.",
            "“I live in fear every day of being on social media and these popping up,” she testified. “I live in fear of my daughters being on social media and these popping up.”",
            "She said the thought keeps her awake at night as she lies next to her 3-year-old and her 5-year-old, and sometimes leads to panic attacks in which she can’t breathe.",
            "Under cross-examination from J. Mira Hashmall, the lawyer representing LA County at the trial, Bryant testified that she had not received any medical diagnosis of having had panic attacks, or any mental health disorder, nor had she taken any medications for them.",
            "She said she had talked to a therapist for about 18 months after the crash, but had not since.",
            "“I feel like sometimes it helps,” Bryant said, “but sometimes it’s completely draining.”",
            "Hashmall spent much of her 90-minute cross-examination going through the business roles Bryant now plays, including acting as president of her husband’s multimedia company, Granity Studios, overseeing the publication of one book he wrote and helping to finish and publish another, heading the foundation started for Kobe and Gianna, and establishing several other companies.",
            "Hashmall suggested that Bryant’s ability to do all of this meant she was functioning well and was not overcome with fear and anxiety.",
            "“It sounds like on top of everything else you’re juggling a business empire,” Hashmall said at one point.",
            "“For me, it’s a labor of love,” said Bryant, who remained calm and composed during cross-examination.",
            "She cried frequently, and laughed occasionally, during the questioning of her attorney Luis Li, who had her describe her life with her “proud girl-dad” husband and their daughters.",
            "“He was just such a beautiful and devoted father,” she said.",
            "Bryant chronicled the day of the crash, her anguish, and her frustration at trying to learn whether her husband and daughter were still alive after she initially heard from an assistant that there were five survivors.",
            "She described Sheriff Villanueva coming into a room where she waited at Lost Hills sheriff’s station and confirming that her husband and daughter had been killed. He asked if there was anything he could do for her.",
            "“I told him, if you can’t bring my babies back, then please secure the area,” Bryant said. “I’m concerned about paparazzi.”",
            "“Did the sheriff tell you one of his deputies had already gone to the hill to take close-up pictures of crash victims?” Li asked.",
            "“No,” Bryant responded.",
            "During cross-examination, Hashmall said the deputy, Doug Johnson, who hiked through tough terrain into the hills in northern Los Angeles County to the crash site and shot the photos that were later shared, was only trying to use them to assess the situation.",
            "“You can understand why he would want the same information you did,” Hashmall said.",
            "“I don’t think you need to take close-up photos of people to determine how many people are on an aircraft,” Bryant replied. “I think he could have just counted.”",
            "Bryant’s side rested its case after her testimony, which came on the eighth day of the trial."

            "ATLANTA (AP) — A Georgia judge on Thursday denied bond — again — for Atlanta rapper Young Thug, one of nearly 30 people charged in a 65-count indictment alleging he is the leader of a criminal street gang.",
            "Superior Court Judge Ural Glanville heard a slew of outstanding motions in the case against the musician, whose real name is Jeffery Williams. Rapper Gunna, whose legal name is Sergio Kitchens, is also charged in the racketeering and gang case. Both men have been in jail since their May arrests.",
            "The musicians are accused of conspiring to violate Georgia’s criminal racketeering law, but the indictment outlines more serious crimes allegedly carried out by “Young Slime Life” associates ranging from drug possession to murder.",

Williams’ attorneys have repeatedly asked that their client be given an ankle monitor and allowed to await trial on house arrest.",

            "Fulton County prosecutor Don Geary asked the judge to further restrict the disclosure of certain evidence ahead of trial, saying a page from discovery that was recently shared online jeopardizes the witness’ safety.",
            "“We found a lot of information concerning one of our witnesses on basically a (celebrity news) outlet,” Geary told Glanville.",
            "Defense attorneys contend that YSL, or Young Stoner Life, is simply the name of Young Thug’s record label, not a violent Atlanta street gang as prosecutors allege.",
            "Thursday’s hearing wasn’t the first time prosecutors have raised concerns about the safety of state’s witnesses. Glanville previously issued a temporary order instructing defense attorneys to withhold witness contact information from their clients.",
            "But Kristen Novay, one of Kitchens’ attorneys, asked prosecutors for proof that potential witnesses are actually being threatened.",
            "“We want to know what specific threats there are,” Novay said. “There have been many allegations that there are threats to witnesses, and to date we have received no discovery, not a single shred of evidence from a witness who was actually threatened.”",
            "In June, an 18-year-old relative of one of the defendants was arrested after allegedly threatening to kill the Fulton County sheriff and his wife unless Williams were released, authorities said, the newspaper reported."

            "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Attorneys for many of the nation’s largest media companies will try to persuade a federal magistrate judge on Thursday afternoon to make public the affidavit supporting the warrant that allowed FBI agents to search former President Donald Trump’s Florida estate last week.",
            "The Associated Press, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, the broadcast TV networks, CNN and others want U.S. Magistrate Judge Bruce E. Reinhart to release the affidavit over the objection of the U.S. Justice Department, which says its investigation of Trump’s handling of “highly classified material” would be compromised.",
            "The media companies argue the affidavit’s release would help the public determine if the Justice Department had legitimate reasons for the search or if it was part of a Biden administration vendetta against Trump, as the former president and his backers contend. Trump, in a Truth Social post last week, called for the release of the unredacted affidavit in the interest of transparency.",
            "“The matter is one of utmost public interest, involving the actions of current and former government officials,” wrote attorney Carol Jean LoCiero, who is representing the Times and others. “President Trump decried the the search as an ‘assault that could only take place in Third World Countries,’ asserted agents ‘even broke into my safe,’ and otherwise challenged the validity of the search.”",
            "Justice Department attorneys argued in a court filing that its investigation into Trump’s handling of “highly classified material” is ongoing and that the document contains sensitive information about witnesses.",
            "The filing by Juan Antonio Gonzalez, the U.S. attorney in Miami, and Jay Bratt, a top Justice Department national security official, says making the affidavit public would “cause significant and irreparable damage to this ongoing criminal investigation.”",
            "“If disclosed, the affidavit would serve as a roadmap to the government’s ongoing investigation, providing specific details about its direction and likely course, in a manner that is highly likely to compromise future investigative steps,” they wrote.",
            "As of Wednesday afternoon, Trump’s attorneys had not indicated on the court’s docket that they plan to take part in the hearing.",
            "FBI agents searched Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate on Aug. 8, removing 11 sets of classified documents, with some not only marked top secret but also “sensitive compartmented information,” according to a receipt of what was taken that was released Friday. That is a special category meant to protect the nation’s most important secrets that if revealed publicly could cause “exceptionally grave” damage to U.S. interests. The court records did not provide specific details about information the documents might contain."

            "The U.S. State Department said Wednesday it is monitoring the case of a Saudi woman sentenced to 34 years in prison for using Twitter to follow accounts and share posts critical of the Kingdom.",
            "Earlier this month, Salma al-Shehab, a PhD student in the U.K. and mother of two, was sentenced to the lengthy prison term, followed by a 34-year travel ban, after she appealed her initial sentence, according to The Washington Post.",
            "Through her Twitter account, al-Shebab called for reforms in her country and for the release of well-known activists and intellectuals, according to the BBC.",
            "This is the longest sentence given to a “peaceful activist,” according to human rights groups cited by the Post, which also reported al-Shebab’s phone was taken and her account on the social media platform will be permanently deleted. For now, her Twitter account remains online.",
            "Ned Price, the State Department’s spokesperson, said the U.S. is “studying” the fact of al-Shebab’s case, according to The Hill.",
            "“Exercising freedom of expression to advocate for the rights of women should not be criminalized. It should never be criminalized,” Price said.",
            "Price continued: “Freedom of expression is a principle that we stand up for around the world. Anytime any government anywhere tramples on such a principle, we speak out and we seek to defend that fundamental right that is as fundamental to individuals in Saudi Arabia as it is to any country around the world.”",
            "Al-Shebab, a Leeds University student and lecturer at the Princess Nourah University in Riyadh, was reportedly detained by Saudi authorities in January 2021, while she was visiting the Kingdom over the holidays. She remains in detention.",
            "Her initial sentence was around six years, according to human rights groups The Freedom House and ALQST, cited by the BBC.",
            "But during her appeal, authorities added new charges, including “assisting those who seek to cause public unrest and destabilise civil and national security by following their Twitter accounts” and sharing their posts, according to the Guardian.",
            "Lina Alhathloul, the head of monitoring and communication for ALQST, a U.K.-based NGO promoting human rights in Saudi Arabia, called the sentence “appalling.”",
            "“This appalling sentence makes a mockery of the Saudi authorities’ claims of reform for women and of the legal system, and shows that they remain hellbent on harshly punishing anyone who expresses their opinions freely,” Alhathloul said. “Saudi activists warned Western leaders that giving legitimacy to the crown prince would pave the way for more abuses, which is unfortunately what we are witnessing now.”",
            "Dr. Bethany Al-Haidari, the Saudi case manager at the Freedom Initiative, a Washington, D.C.-based NGO working to secure the release of prisoners in the Middle East and North Africa, echoed Alhathloul in calling for Al-Shebab’s immediate release.",
            "“It is unfortunately no surprise that MBS feels more empowered than ever in presiding over such egregious rights violations. Without any real steps toward accountability, Biden’s trip to Jeddah and the international community’s embrace must feel like a green light” for the punishments, Al-Haidari said.",
            "President Joe Biden visited Saudi Arabia last month, where he met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded was behind the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.",
            "Biden sought to justify the trip, claiming he would secure commitments from MBS to increase gas supply, therefore lowering gas prices at home, as well as better treatment of dissidents."

            "NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. is setting aside an extra 50,000 doses of monkeypox vaccine for places with upcoming gay pride events, health officials said Thursday.",
            "The number of doses sent to each place will be based on factors like the size of the event, how many health workers will be available to give shots, and how many of the attendees are considered at highest risk for catching the virus.",
            "“More shots in arms is how we get the outbreak under control,” Bob Fenton, the White House monkeypox response coordinator, told reporters Thursday. He said the effort is an attempt to “meet people where they are.”",
            "At least a dozen U.S. pride events are scheduled over the next two months, including large gatherings in Atlanta and New Orleans in early September. U.S. officials said they will send up to 2,000 additional doses to North Carolina, where the Charlotte Pride Festival & Parade will be held this weekend.",

The Bourbon Street Extravaganza, a free concert held amid the event, has been canceled over monkeypox concerns, organizers said this week.",
            "Frank Perez, a former grand marshal of the parade that’s the centerpiece of Southern Decadence, said a number of New Orleans gay bars have already had vaccine events. He said so far officials have done an adequate job with the vaccine campaign although “more is better.”",
            "Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, cautioned: “While we are offering the vaccine at these events to those at high risk, this is a two-dose vaccine series, and receiving the vaccine at the event will not provide protection at the event itself.”",

The vast majority have occurred in men who have sex with men, but health officials stress that anyone can get monkeypox.The U.S. has the most infections of any country — more than 13,500. About 98% of U.S. cases are men and about 93% were men who reported recent sexual contact with other men.Officials say the virus has been spreading mainly through skin-on-skin contact, but they warn it might also transmit in other ways, including through touching linens used by someone with monkeypox.People with monkeypox may experience fever, body aches, chills and fatigue. Many in the outbreak have developed extremely painful zit-like bumps. No one in the U.S. has died, but deaths have been reported in other countries.The U.S. has a limited supply of what is considered the main weapon against the virus — a vaccine called Jynneos. The doses are currently being given to people soon after they think they were exposed. Scientists are still trying to establish how well the shots are working.The government last week moved to stretch the supply by giving people one-fifth the usual dose, injected just under the skin, instead of a full vial injected into deeper tissue.Many health workers may have little experience giving shots using the just-under-the-skin method, which requires different needles and syringes. Some health departments have started doing that, but some local officials have said they may need a week or more to make the change.Officials this week announced the release of 442,000 of the smaller doses for order by state, local and territorial health departments. On Thursday, they said more is coming next week — 1.8 million doses, or 360,000 vials.Officials also announced a new agreement with a Michigan manufacturer to help speed production of 5.5 million vaccine vials recently ordered by the U.S. government.Under the deal, Grand River Aseptic Manufacturing will help package raw vaccine ingredients currently stored at an overseas facility owned by Bavarian Nordic, which makes the Jynneos vaccine. Officials said the extra capacity should help speed up U.S. vaccine orders, most of which weren’t expected to be delivered until next year. The Biden administration has faced weeks of criticism for not ordering more vaccine sooner.Also on Thursday, health officials said next week they will boost the supply of TPOXX, a drug for treating monkeypox infections, by 50,000 treatment courses.___AP reporters Rebecca Santana in New Orleans and Matthew Perrone in Washington contributed to this report.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

            "NEW YORK (AP) — Donald Trump’s chief financial officer is expected to plead guilty to tax violations Thursday in a deal that would require him to testify about illicit business practices at the former president’s company, two people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press.",
            "Allen Weisselberg is charged with taking more than $1.7 million in off-the-books compensation from the Trump Organization over several years, including untaxed perks like rent, car payments and school tuition.",
            "The plea deal would require Weisselberg to speak in court Thursday about the company’s role in the alleged compensation arrangement and possibly serve as a witness when the Trump Organization goes on trial in October on related charges, the people said. Weisselberg also will not implicate Mr. Trump or his family should he take the stand, The New York Times reports.",
            "The two people were not authorized to speak publicly about the case and did so on condition of anonymity.",
            "Weisselberg, 75, is likely to receive a sentence of five months in jail, to be served at New York City’s notorious Rikers Island complex, and he could be required to pay about $2 million in restitution, including taxes, penalties and interest, the people said. If that punishment holds, Weisselberg would be eligible for release after about 100 days.",
            "Messages seeking comment were left with the Manhattan district attorney’s office and lawyers for Weisselberg and the Trump Organization.",
            "Weisselberg is the only person to face criminal charges so far in the Manhattan district attorney’s long-running investigation of the company’s business practices.",
            "Seen as one of Trump’s most loyal business associates, Weisselberg was arrested in July 2021. His lawyers have argued the Democrat-led district attorney’s office was punishing him because he wouldn’t offer information that would damage Trump.",
            "The district attorney has also been investigating whether Trump or his company lied to banks or the government about the value of its properties to obtain loans or reduce tax bills.",
            "Former District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., who started the investigation, last year directed his deputies to present evidence to a grand jury and seek an indictment of Trump, according to former prosecutor Mark Pomerantz, who previously led the probe.",
            "But after Vance left office, his successor, Alvin Bragg, allowed the grand jury to disband without charges. Both prosecutors are Democrats. Bragg has said the investigation is continuing.",
            "The Trump Organization is not involved in Weisselberg’s expected guilty plea Thursday and is scheduled to be tried in the alleged compensation scheme in October.",
            "Prosecutors alleged that the company gave untaxed fringe benefits to senior executives, including Weisselberg, for 15 years. Weisselberg alone was accused of defrauding the federal government, state and city out of more than $900,000 in unpaid taxes and undeserved tax refunds.",
            "Under state law, punishment for the most serious charge against Weisselberg, grand larceny, could carry a penalty as high as 15 years in prison. But the charge carries no mandatory minimum, and most first-time offenders in tax-related cases never end up behind bars.",
            "The tax fraud charges against the Trump Organization are punishable by a fine of double the amount of unpaid taxes, or $250,000, whichever is larger.",
            "Trump has not been charged in the criminal probe. The Republican has decried the New York investigations as a “political witch hunt,” has said his company’s actions were standard practice in the real estate business and in no way a crime.",
            "Last week, Trump sat for a deposition in New York Attorney General Letitia James’ parallel civil investigation into allegations Trump’s company misled lenders and tax authorities about asset values. Trump invoked his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination more than 400 times."

            "Deshaun Watson has reached a settlement with the NFL and will serve an 11-game suspension and pay a $5 million fine rather than risk missing his first season as quarterback of the Cleveland Browns, a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press.",
            "Watson was accused of sexual misconduct by two dozen women while he played for the Houston Texans. The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity Thursday in disclosing the settlement between Watson and the league, which had sought to ban him for at least one year for violating its personal conduct policy, because the agreement had not been announcement.",
            "The settlement ends months of posturing between Watson’s legal team, the NFL and NFL Players Association.",
            "As part of the settlement, Watson may return for the Browns’ game on Dec. 4 in Houston.",
            "On Aug. 1, the three-time Pro Bowler was suspended six games by Sue L. Robinson, a former federal judge jointly appointed by the league and union to act as an independent disciplinary officer.",
            "Robinson found the 26-year-old Watson violated the league’s personal conduct policy after reviewing an investigation into his actions and called his behavior “egregious” and “predatory.”",
            "Believing the suspension was too light, the league appealed and pushed Watson’s case back to Goodell, who had handled all player discipline in the past. The league previously pushed for an indefinite suspension and hefty fine.",
            "Goodell appointed former New Jersey Attorney General Peter C. Harvey to hear the appeal. Harvey is an attorney who was previously involved in the NFL’s decision to suspend Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott for six games during the 2017 season for domestic violence allegations.",
            "Per the 2020 collective bargaining agreement, Harvey’s decision would have constituted “full, final and complete disposition of the dispute.”",
            "At the owners’ meetings this month, Goodell said the league’s pursuit of a yearlong ban was warranted following its investigation and Robinson’s findings.",
            "“She reinforced the evidence,” Goodell said. “There were multiple violations that were egregious, and it was predatory behavior.”",
            "In her conclusion, Robinson cited Watson’s lack of remorse as a factor in her decision. Watson apologized for the first time “to all the women that I have impacted” before making his Browns’ debut in an exhibition in Jacksonville.",
            "Watson was accused of being sexually inappropriate with the women during massage therapy sessions from March 2020 to March 2021 in Texas. In civil lawsuits filed in Texas, the women accused Watson of exposing himself, touching them with his penis or kissing them against their will. One woman alleged Watson forced her to perform oral sex.",
            "Two separate grand juries in Texas declined to indict Watson, who has denied any wrongdoing. He recently settled 23 of 24 lawsuits.",
            "For now, the suspension ends months of speculation about whether Watson would play in 2022 for the Browns, who outbid several other teams, traded three first-round draft picks to the Texans in March and signed the QB to a five-year, $230 million contract.",
            "Watson’s case sparked strong opinions while raising questions about the league’s handling of player discipline and its spotty record of supporting women.",
            "The Browns believe Watson could make them a Super Bowl contender. Without him, they could struggle to simply contend in the AFC North against defending conference champion Cincinnati along with Baltimore and Pittsburgh.",
            "The suspension also means Watson will be idle longer. One of pro football’s elite QBs, he sat out last season in Houston after demanding a trade and before the sexual allegations surfaced.",
            "In her 16-page ruling, Robinson found that the league proved its case that Watson violated three provisions of the conduct policy: sexual assault as defined by the league, posing a genuine danger to the safety and well-being of another and undermining or putting the league’s integrity at risk.",
            "Robinson also pointed out flaws in the league’s conduct policy, saying it was unfair to “identify conduct as prohibited only after the conduct has been committed, just as it is inherently unjust to change the penalties for such conduct after the fact.”",
            "Her punishment was criticized by several organizations, including The National Organization for Women, which called it “unacceptable, insulting and dangerous — but not surprising. The NFL and the multibillion-dollar sports industry have a vested interest in enabling sexual misconduct, assault and violence.”",
            "Attorney Tony Buzbee, who represents all 24 women who sued Watson, and Ashley Solis, the first woman to go public with allegations against Watson, decried the original six-game suspension at a news conference in Houston in early August.",
            "Watson has continued to practice while his case made its way through the league’s process.",
            "All along, the Browns’ plan was to turn their offense over to veteran Jacoby Brissett, who has made 37 career starts, during Watson’s suspension. But it’s now possible Cleveland will explore other options at quarterback.",

            "It’s been less than a month since former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson first posted his contempt for Hulu moving forward with “Mike,” the upcoming miniseries based upon his life, without consulting or paying him. Last week, he also doubled down in an Instagram Live conversation with Mario Lopez expressing his issues.",
            "And so far, it looks like many are siding with him and throwing all anticipation they might have once had for the series out the window by not watching it at all when it premieres on Aug. 25. But despite Tyson’s claims that his life story was “stolen” from him, Hulu is not obligated to involve him at all.",
            "“You don’t need to actually get life story rights,” entertainment attorney Mitra Ahouraian told HuffPost. “It’s not a legal necessity. It’s something that’s good practice, and it’s something that’s very often done for a number of reasons.”",
            "For one thing, Ahouraian says it’s to prevent claims of defamation or violation of their rights of publicity, assuming they’re telling a truthful story. It also makes it easier to get financing and errors and omissions insurance, which is required for distribution. All of this, especially the money aspect, is attractive to a reputable studio or production company.",
            "Authorized stories also allow the storytellers access to the subject and the ability to consult with them. That access extends toward the actors portraying them — Trevante Rhodes, in the case of “Mike.”",
            "Like “having access to some of their stories that are unknown or unspoken,” Ahouraian adds. “Having access to certain materials like photographs, or maybe letters they’ve written, or even people in their inner circle that you might not necessarily have access to.”",
            "So, in that sense, there is certainly an appeal for a movie to be authorized. And for what it’s worth, it’s understandable that Tyson would be bitter about not being a part of his own story, and will not reap any of its profit.",
            "“It is kind of a frustrating thing for celebrities in general that anyone could go out there and write about them,” Ahouraian agrees. “But the law says when you put yourself out there as a public figure, you have less rights than a private individual ― even [one] whose facts become public.”",
            "Fans can certainly be sympathetic to that. But the “Mike” situation is far from the first time that a subject has no participation in a project about them, and it’s not even the first time this year that they have been irate about it.",
            "NBA legend Jerry West even threatened to take his claims against HBO’s portrayal of him in “Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty” all the way to the Supreme Court.",
            "Pamela Anderson refused to engage with Hulu’s other series, “Pam & Tommy,” which recontextualizes her and ex-husband Tommy Lee’s sex tape scandal as the traumatic and sexist event that it was, especially for the former “Baywatch” actor. She, like Tyson, vowed to tell her own account of her story with a separate upcoming project.",
            "But as we saw with “Pam & Tommy,” just because a star isn’t involved with a project about their life doesn’t automatically mean the story is bad, inaccurate or defamatory. The series is actually quite empathetic to Anderson’s ordeal. It also crystallizes how women’s bodies are no longer their own once they become a celebrity, an issue we’re still reckoning with today.",
            "Ahouraian says that people have different reasons for reacting to things like that. Anderson didn’t necessarily want to revisit this time in her life. Meanwhile, Mike Tyson seems to want to be his own storyteller.",
            "“But also I think: What can there possibly be in [‘Mike’] that we haven’t already heard?” Ahouraian asks. “Stories of women? I don’t know. There isn’t much, I think, that can be told beyond what we already know other than we’re putting it all in one place as a story.”",
            "The matter of truth, though, is a tricky one because dramatized accounts like “Pam & Tommy,” “Winning Time” and even “Mike” are first and foremost indebted to the idea of what makes a good story. That means some things might be embellished, which is a turnoff for some viewers going in with the expectation that they’re watching a word-for-word chronicle of someone’s life.",
            "That’s not their purpose.",
            "And even those sometimes have the full support of the subject, or, like in the case of Netflix’s upcoming Marilyn Monroe drama “Blonde,” their estate.",
            "“Having the cooperation, I think, is more important when you’re planning on things that make the story better or more cinematic or more engaging,” Ahouraian expounds. “Some things you play up, some things you play down.”",
            "She thinks about that before adding, “And we all know what plays well for entertainment is sort of different in big movies or things that are dramatized.”",
            "That’s definitely sometimes true. But it’s also important to point out here that many estates like Marilyn Monroe’s aren’t always invested in the storytelling aspect. In fact, oftentimes their main incentive is money.",
            "“So, if there’s something that could potentially make the trust money, that’s really where the duty lies,” Ahouraian said, “versus the family member who could put a stop to things [that] have different incentives, perhaps.”",
            "That only underscores the fact that not every movie or TV series that is authorized automatically makes it a better or more thoughtful story. Or even a complete one, for that matter. Because sometimes even those who authorize it have other objectives.",
            "This includes celebrities who authorize and appear in documentaries and docuseries about them. A concern that immediately comes to mind is how much control they have over the narrative, which in turn sparks questions about what is being left out of it.",
            "Like, what is the point of watching Jennifer Lopez rehash her storied career and unparalleled ambition in the Netflix documentary “Halftime” — especially when it doesn’t also challenge her on some of the valid issues fans have brought up about her over the years?",
            "Or what makes Lifetime’s “Janet Jackson” docuseries worth our time if it’s only going to explore all the things even a casual fan of the pop star has already known for years — her incredible talent, the many well-documented stories about her family, the speculation about her weight?",
            "If we’re not learning anything new, or if the story is so heavily curated that it could have easily been an Instagram reel, then why bother with it?",
            "Ahouraian suggests that in today’s day and age, fans’ access to a celebrity is everything. It brings them that much closer to their favorite star.",
            "“Anytime you have a fan, it’s somebody who is an advocate of the artist or the celebrity,” she said. “And so they’re very much invested in hearing their true story coming from them, especially at a time where we have such accessibility to our celebrities with social media and everything.”",
            "But then you can ask the same questions that you would if it was unauthorized: What is missing or being embellished in this story? What information does the celebrity feel that they have a reason to protect?",
            "This most recently came to mind when Madonna confirmed that she would direct a movie about her life. She had an understandable reason — so her personal story wouldn’t get into the wrong, “misogynistic” hands — but the concerns remain the same: Which story will she tell, and how will she tell it?",
            "“That’s the nature of when people talk about celebrities; there’s always this aspect of ‘we want scandal’ versus ‘I would love to hear Madonna’s story,’” Ahouraian said. “I would much rather have her tell it than somebody who never even grew up with Madonna. Right?”",
            "Context will be critical with Madonna’s story — as it should be with anyone else’s. And it’s possible that someone who didn’t experience, say, ’80s Madonna in real time won’t understand that. But the subject doing their own storytelling? That just brings up another uneasiness.",
            "Although ― there’s something to be said about the fact that someone like Tyson, who must realize that he doesn’t have a legal case against Hulu, used his platform in such a way that some of his most devoted fans have already abandoned “Mike.” It’s a manipulation of control and power back into his own hands.",
            "“I think that that’s why he’s taken to the public, right?” Ahouraian asked. “Because he does have a powerful fan base — even on the Live it was like, ‘We’re going to boycott Hulu, and we’re not going to watch the [series].’”",
            "But Ahouraian also notes, Tyson’s rants might accidentally get others actually interested in the show.",
            "“There will be fans who are like, ‘We’re not going to support this thing that you don’t support,’” she explained. “And on the other hand, [there will be a] curiosity of other people who are like, ‘What’s in this thing that he doesn’t want out there?’”",
            "That’s the double-edge sword here, but it’s really all Tyson has. “That’s the power of celebrity,” Ahouraian said, referring to Tyson’s social media tactics. “But he doesn’t have other recourse, which is why he’s turning to that.”",
            "And for those who choose not to watch “Mike,” will it be because of Tyson’s animus toward it or because they don’t trust the material? We might never know."

            "Talks between the NFL and NFL Players Association on a discipline settlement for Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson have progressed. However, it’s uncertain whether the two sides will reach a deal, two people familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press on Wednesday.",
            "The people spoke to AP on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case.",
            "The sides are seeking a compromise before any punishment is handed down by Peter C. Harvey, a former New Jersey attorney general who was appointed by Commissioner Roger Goodell to rule on the league’s appeal of a six-game suspension already imposed on Watson by an independent disciplinary officer.",
            "Last week, the AP was told Watson was willing to accept an eight-game suspension and $5 million fine. The league has been seeking a lengthier punishment for Watson, who was accused of sexual assault and sexual harassment by two dozen women in Texas.",
            "The three-time Pro Bowl QB was allegedly sexually inappropriate with the women during massage therapy appointments while he played for the Houston Texans. Watson settled 23 of 24 civil lawsuits filed by the women.",
            "It’s not known if Harvey is waiting for the sides to exhaust any possibilities of a settlement before ruling.",
            "A settlement could get Watson on the field this season for the Browns, who traded three first-round draft picks — and five overall — for one of the game’s top QBs in March and signed him to a fully guaranteed $230 million contract.",
            "Watson has always denied any wrongdoing. Shortly before his debut for the Browns last week, Watson apologized for the first time “to all the women I’ve impacted.”",
            "Watson’s contrition came as Harvey considered the league’s appeal of a ruling by independent arbiter Sue L. Robinson, who found the 26-year-old violated the league’s personal conduct policy with his alleged lewd behavior.",
            "Robinson called his actions “egregious” and predatory and while she levied a six-game suspension, the league wasn’t satisfied and appealed. The NFL had been seeking a year-long suspension.",
            "For months, the Browns have operated under the assumption Watson would be out for at least part of the 2022 season. Veteran Jacoby Brissett is slotted to start while Watson is out, but a full-season ban could move the team to hit the market for another quality QB.",
            "Following his apology last week, Watson showed rust in an abbreviated preseason appearance in Jacksonville, his first game action in nearly 600 days. Watson badly overthrew his first pass and finished 1 of 5 for 7 yards in three series.",
            "Brissett began getting the majority of work with Cleveland’s first-team offense this week. He’s not expected to play in Sunday’s home exhibition against Philadelphia. Browns coach Kevin Stefanski hasn’t disclosed the team’s plans for Watson against the Eagles, who will practice with the Browns in Berea, Ohio, on Thursday and Friday.",

            "NEW YORK (AP) — The head of nation’s top public health agency on Wednesday announced a shake-up of the organization, intended to make it more nimble.",
            "The planned changes at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — CDC leaders call it a “reset”— come amid ongoing criticism of the agency’s response to COVID-19, monkeypox and other public health threats. The changes include internal staffing moves and steps to speed up data releases.",
            "The CDC’s director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, told the agency’s staff about the changes on Wednesday. It’s a CDC initiative, and was not directed by the White House or other administration officials, she said.",
            "“I feel like it’s my my responsibility to lead this agency to a better place after a really challenging three years,” Walensky told The Associated Press.",
            "The CDC, with a $12 billion budget and more than 11,000 employees, is an Atlanta-based federal agency charged with protecting Americans from disease outbreaks and other public health threats. It’s customary for each CDC director to do some reorganizing, but Walensky’s action comes amid a wider demand for change.",
            "The agency has long been criticized as too ponderous, focusing on collection and analysis of data but not acting quickly against new health threats. But public unhappiness with the agency grew dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts said the CDC was slow to recognize how much virus was entering the U.S. from Europe, to recommend people wear masks, to say the virus can spread through the air, and to ramp up systematic testing for new variants.",
            "“We saw during COVID that CDC’s structures, frankly, weren’t designed to take in information, digest it and disseminate it to the public at the speed necessary,” said Jason Schwartz, a health policy researcher at the Yale School of Public Health.",
            "Walensky, who became director in January 2021, has long said the agency has to move faster and communicate better, but stumbles have continued during her tenure.",
            "In April, she called for an in-depth review of the agency, which resulted in the announced changes. Her reorganization proposal must be approved by the Department of Health and Human Services secretary. CDC officials say they hope to have a full package of changes finalized, approved, and underway by early next year.",
            "Some changes still are being formulated, but steps announced Wednesday include:",
            "—Increasing use of preprint scientific reports to get out actionable data, instead of waiting for research to go through peer review and publication by the CDC journal Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.",
            "—Restructuring the agency’s communications office and further revamping CDC websites to make the agency’s guidance for the public more clear and easier to find.",
            "—Altering the length of time agency leaders are devoted to outbreak responses to a minimum of six months — an effort to address a turnover problem that at times caused knowledge gaps and affected the agency’s communications.",
            "—Creation of a new executive council to help Walensky set strategy and priorities.",
            "—Appointing Mary Wakefield as senior counselor to implement the changes. Wakefield headed the Health Resources and Services Administration during the Obama administration and also served as the No. 2 administrator at HHS. Wakefield, 68, started Monday.",
            "—Altering the agency’s organization chart to undo some changes made during the Trump administration.",
            "—Establishing an office of intergovernmental affairs to smooth partnerships with other agencies, as well as a higher-level office on health equity.",
            "Walensky also said she intends to “get rid of some of the reporting layers that exist, and I’d like to work to break down some of the silos.” She did not say exactly what that may entail, but emphasized that the overall changes are less about redrawing the organization chart than rethinking how the CDC does business and motivates staff.",
            "“This will not be simply moving boxes” on the organization chart, she said.",
            "Schwartz said flaws in the federal response go beyond the CDC, because the White House and other agencies were heavily involved.",
            "A CDC reorganization is a positive step but “I hope it’s not the end of the story,” Schwartz said. He would like to see “a broader accounting” of how the federal government handles health crises.",

            "WASHINGTON (AP) — Planned Parenthood, the nation’s leading reproductive health care provider and abortion rights advocacy organization, plans to spend a record $50 million ahead of November’s midterm elections, pouring money into contests where access to abortion will be on the ballot.",
            "The effort, which breaks the group’s previous $45 million spending record set in 2020, comes months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case that created a constitutional right to have an abortion. It will be waged by the organization’s political and advocacy arms and will focus on governor’s offices, U.S. Senate seats and legislative races in nine states where abortion rights could be restricted or expanded depending on the outcome at the ballot.",
            "The historic proportions of the midterm campaign, when less money is usually spent, were made possible by a torrent of money raised after the decision by the high court’s new conservative majority, touching off a tectonic shift in the politics of abortion. Now, for the first time, Republicans who have long campaigned against abortion and Roe v. Wade will face voters on an issue that is no longer hypothetical and carries real life consequences.",
            "Planned Parenthood says its spending will help remind voters in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin what’s at stake in a bid to drive turnout by Democratic and independent voters.",
            "“Who wins in these midterm elections will determine whether a state has access to abortion and potentially determine whether we will face a national abortion ban,” said Jenny Lawson, the executive director of Planned Parenthood Votes. “We will be clear about who is on which side.”",
            "A recent poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found a majority of Americans think Congress should pass a law guaranteeing access to legal abortion nationwide. More than half of the respondents said they feel at least somewhat “sad” or “angry” about the Supreme Court’s decision.",
            "Earlier this month in red-state Kansas, voters rejected by nearly 20 percentage points a constitutional amendment that would have allowed the legislature to advance a ban on abortion.",
            "Whether it truly is a galvanizing issue will become clear after Election Day, Nov. 8.",
            "“We say this every cycle: ‘This is the important election,’” said Amy Kennedy, a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Votes in Georgia. “For us, this really is the most important election cycle of our life.”",
            "Planned Parenthood says it intends to contact 6 million voters through door knocking, phone calls, digital advertising, mailers and radio ads. It has already run some TV ads in Wisconsin, where Republicans control the statehouse and where Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson are up for reelection.",
            "It also is launching a website, takecontrol2022.com.",
            "While the Supreme Court’s ruling in June effectively left setting abortion policy to the states, Planned Parenthood says it is also investing in U.S. Senate races because Republicans have expressed an interest in pursuing a national abortion ban, though such a measure would almost certainly be vetoed by President Joe Biden.",
            "Democrats and their allies have long tried, without much success, to energize supporters by focusing on abortion. But the Supreme Court’s decision clarified the stakes as never before. In roughly a dozen states led by Republicans, abortion has already been banned or heavily restricted. Many more are expected to follow.",
            "“When people go to vote this November, nearly half of the folks voting could be living in a state that either has already banned abortion or is quickly moving to ban abortion. These are entirely new circumstances,” Lawson said. “There are a lot of issues people care about, certainly, but the state of abortion access is absolutely one of the defining issues this November.”"

            "Terrance “T.J.” Cox was arrested by agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigations in Fresno, where he was booked to the Fresno County jail on a U.S. Marshals hold, jail records showed. It was not immediately known if he has an attorney who can speak on his behalf. An email message sent to Cox Tuesday was not immediately answered.",
            "Cox, a Democrat, represented the 21st Congressional District from January 2019 to January 2021. The district is in the agriculture-rich San Joaquin Valley and includes Kings County and portions of Fresno, Kern and Tulare counties.",
            "Cox, 59, was charged with 15 counts of wire fraud, 11 counts of money laundering, one count of financial institution fraud, and one count of campaign contribution fraud, U.S. Attorney Phillip Talbert said in a statement.",
            "Talbert said that between 2013 and 2018, Cox allegedly obtained $1.7 million from funds he solicited from clients and loans he got for his companies and then stole by diverting the money to “off-the-book bank accounts.”",
            "Cox partially owned, managed and was employed by several companies and non-profit organizations, including a business that helped companies get loans and federal tax credits, an almond processing company and a non-profit that operated Granite Park, a recreation facility in Fresno, according to the complaint.",
            "Cox also fraudulently obtained a $1.5 million construction loan to develop Granite Park, Talbert said.",
            "After his nonprofit could not qualify for the construction loan for the recreation facility without a party guaranteeing the loan, Cox said that one of the companies he co-owned would guarantee the loan, and submitted a fabricated board resolution that falsely stated that during a meeting all company owners had agreed to guarantee the Granite Park loan.",
            "“No meeting took place, and the other owners did not agree to back the loan,” Talbert said.",
            "The loan later went into default, causing a loss of more than $1.28 million, he said.",
            "According to the indictment, when Cox was campaigning in 2017 for the U.S. House of Representatives he reimbursed family members and associates for donations to his campaign, prosecutors said. Cox arranged for over $25,000 in illegal straw or conduit donations to his campaign, Talbert said.",
            "If convicted, Cox faces up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine for wire fraud and money laundering, and up to 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine for wire fraud affecting a financial institution. The charge of campaign contribution fraud carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine,"

            "The dog had no previous medical disorders but presented with lesions and pustules on its abdomen 12 days after the men. The pair said they had kept the dog away from other people and animals, but that it had slept in their bed with them.",

            "Prior to the Broncos’ purchase, there were only two non-white owners of NFL teams and zero Black owners — a glaring statistic for a league in which an estimated 70% of players are either Black or a person of color. Kim Pegula, a South Korean woman, currently co-owns the Buffalo Bills with her husband, while Shahid Rafiq Khan, a Pakistani American, owns the Jacksonville Jaguars.",
            "The NFL has made previous efforts to become more diverse, including enacting the 2003 Rooney Rule, which promised to put more effort into hiring and recruiting non-white coaches and executives.",
            "However, some claim those efforts didn’t go far enough.",
            "The league’s long-standing issues of race and hiring hit a fever pitch in February when Brian Flores, senior defensive assistant and linebacker coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers, filed a lawsuit claiming racial discrimination against the NFL and three separate teams, including the Broncos.",
            "After Flores was fired as the Miami Dolphins head coach in January, he claimed the league’s leadership racially discriminated against Black employees and said the NFL “lives in a time of the past.”",
            "Flores said in the suit that the NFL “remains rife with racism, particularly when it comes to the hiring and retention of Black Head Coaches, Coordinators, and General Managers.”",
            "In his lawsuit, Flores claimed Dolphins owner Stephen Ross orchestrated a pay-to-lose scheme in which Ross offered Flores $100,000 for every game he intentionally lost to forfeit the season for better draft picks.",
            "Flores’ lawsuit also claimed that the Broncos interviewed him for a head coach position in 2019 only to satisfy the Rooney Rule, which requires teams to “interview with at least one external minority candidate” for the position.",
            "Additionally, Flores claimed he found out that he was being excluded from an open New York Giants head coach position only after New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick mistakenly sent him a text message congratulating him for securing the role — which Belichick actually meant to send to Brian Daboll. At that point, Flores hadn’t yet had his interview with the Giants for the same position.",
            "The NFL maintains that Flores’ lawsuit is “without merit” and in June filed a motion to force Flores’ class-action lawsuit into arbitration, according to the AP.",
            "Flores’ plight as a Black coach transfers directly into the conversation surrounding more diverse representation in ownership within the NFL.",
            "In his lawsuit, Flores said he believes the NFL must work to “ensure diversity of ownership by creating and funding a committee dedicated to sourcing Black investors to take majority ownership stakes in NFL Teams.”",
            "The recent purchase of the Denver Broncos is a pivotal move in the right direction for the NFL, a league that currently has only three black coaches.",
            "“Thinking about the ownership group with Lewis, Mellody, and Dr. Rice, this is a rare atmosphere that we’re in right now,” Wilson told the Denver Post days after the sale was finalized. “It’s amazing to see African-American people leading and being a part of this.”"

            "LONDON (AP) — A law has taken effect in Scotland to ensure period products are available free of charge to anyone who needs them.",
            "The Scottish government said it became the first in the world to legally protect the right to access free period products when its Period Products Act came into force Monday.",
            "Under the new law, schools, colleges and universities as well as local government bodies must make a range of period products such as tampons and sanitary pads available for free in their bathrooms. The Scottish government already invested millions of pounds since 2017 to fund free period products in educational institutions, but the law makes it a legal requirement.",
            "A mobile phone app also helps people find the nearest place — such as the local library or community center — where they can pick up period products.",
            "“Providing access to free period products is fundamental to equality and dignity, and removes the financial barriers to accessing them,” Scottish Social Justice Secretary Shona Robison said.",
            "“This is more important than ever at a time when people are making difficult choices due to the cost of living crisis and we never want anyone to be in a position where they cannot access period products,” she added.",
            "The bill, which was passed unanimously in 2020, was introduced by Scottish Parliament lawmaker Monica Lennon, who had campaigned against “period poverty” — when someone who needs sanitary products can’t afford them.",
            "“Proud of what we have achieved in Scotland,” Lennon tweeted Monday. “We are the first but won’t be the last.”",

            "WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — The PGA Tour is in Delaware for the first time and the buzz still surrounded Tiger Woods, even if he didn’t have clubs and might not be seen.",
            "Woods was scheduled to come to Wilmington Country Club on Tuesday for a private meeting of top players to discuss the threat of Saudi-funded LIV Golf, according to two people aware of the plans at the BMW Championship.",
            "They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because of the privacy of the meeting. One person invited to the meeting said it was to get on the same page against LIV Golf, along with taking more ownership in the direction of the PGA Tour.",
            "The meeting led to a previously scheduled Players Advisory Council meeting being moved back an hour so to later Tuesday afternoon.",
            "“There is a player meeting, but that’s all I can tell you about that,” Jon Rahm said.",
            "It was not clear if PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan would be involved. He met with the players informally last week following a hearing in which a federal judge denied a request by three LIV Golf players seeking to play in the PGA Tour postseason.",
            "Monahan also met with the players a week after the U.S. Open to details plans for big increases in prize money on the PGA Tour, qualifying changes and a new schedule that will return to a January start to the season in 2024.",
            "Woods has been a strong opponent of LIV Golf. The rival league’s leader, Greg Norman, confirmed in an interview with Fox News last month that Woods was offered in the range of $700 to $800 million to take part. Norman said that was before he was hired to run LIV Golf.",
            "Norman and Woods have never been close, going back to when Woods arrived on the PGA Tour and instantly became the biggest star golf had seen in generations.",
            "Woods was particularly forceful at the British Open last month when he said of Norman not being invited to festivities around the 150th Open, “Greg has done some things that I don’t think is in the best interest of our game.”",
            "He said he disagreed with players getting enormous signing bonuses to defect to LIV Golf, saying they have turned their backs on the tour that made them famous.",
            "The PGA Tour has reacted to the depth of Saudi funding with a $50 million bonus pool called the Player Impact Program that pays 10 leading players based on how much attention they get. Some players, such as defending FedEx Cup champion Patrick Cantlay, don’t like the program.",
            "Also in the works is a series of overseas tournaments at the end of the year that will reward the top performers. The tour hasn’t announced set details or a sponsor.",
            "LIV Golf has played three events offering $25 million apiece in prize money to a group of players that include Dustin Johnson, Brooks Koepka, Phil Mickelson and Bryson DeChambeau. It resumes its eight-tournament schedule after the FedEx Cup ends next week.",

            "KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — The Taliban on Monday marked a year since they seized the Afghan capital in a rapid takeover that triggered a hasty escape of the nation’s Western-backed leaders, sent the economy into a tailspin and fundamentally transformed the country.",
            "Bearded Taliban fighters, some hoisting rifles or the white banners of their movement, staged victory parades on foot, bicycles and motorcycles in the streets of Kabul. One group marched past the former U.S. Embassy, chanting “Long live Islam” and “Death to America.”",
            "A year after the dramatic day, much has changed in Afghanistan. The former insurgents struggle to govern and remain internationally isolated. The economic downturn has driven millions more Afghans into poverty and even hunger, as the flow of foreign aid slowed to a trickle.",
            "The U.N. humanitarian chief for Afghanistan warned that unless donors provide $2.6 billion very soon the country faces “pure catastrophe” over the coming winter with millions of lives at stake.",
            "Ramiz Alakbarov told a virtual news conference from Kabul that the U.N.’s $4.4 billion humanitarian appeal for Afghanistan this year has received only about $1.8 billion, leaving a $2.6 billion gap in funding for desperately needed food and other aid.",
            "He said over 90 million people in Afghanistan are “food insecure,” around 35 million are living in poverty, and 6.6 million are classified in the emergency level just one step from famine.",
            "Alakbarov said he just visited several hospitals and saw “heartbreaking scenes” of malnourished children who will not survive the winter without additional support.",
            "While the Afghan people are known for their resilience and ability to survive, he said, unfortunately “negative coping strategies” including the selling of organs and the selling of children will be seen again “if support is not provided.”",
            "Meanwhile, hardliners appear to hold sway in the Taliban-led government, which imposed severe restrictions on access to education and jobs for girls and women, despite initial promises to the contrary. A year on, teenage girls are still barred from school and women are required to cover themselves head-to-toe in public, with only the eyes showing.",
            "Some are trying to find ways to keep education from stalling for a generation of young women and underground schools in homes have sprung up.",
            "Natalia Kanem, executive director of the U.N.’s sexual and reproductive health agency, said in a statement that Afghan females must not be forgotten.",
            "“As the world faces multiple, overlapping crises, we must not forget the women and girls of Afghanistan. When women’s and girls’ basic rights are denied, we are all diminished,” she said.",
            "A year ago, thousands of Afghans had rushed to Kabul International Airport to flee the Taliban amid the U.S. military’s chaotic withdrawal from Kabul after 20 years of war — America’s longest conflict.",
            "Some flights resumed relatively quickly after those chaotic days. On Monday, a handful of commercial flights were scheduled to land and take off from a runway that last summer saw Afghan men clinging to the wheels of planes taking off, some falling to their death.",
            "Schoolyards stood empty Monday as the Taliban announced a public holiday to mark the day, which they refer to as “The Proud Day of Aug. 15” and the “First Anniversary of the Return to Power.”",
            "“Reliance on God and the support of the people brought this great victory and freedom to the country,” wrote Abdul Wahid Rayan, the head of the Taliban-run Bakhtar News Agency. “Today, Aug. 15, marks the victory of Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan against America and its allies occupation of Afghanistan.”",
            "During a gathering to mark the anniversary, the Taliban deputy prime minister, Abdul Salam Hanafi, offered congratulations to “the entire nation on the day of the conquest of Kabul, which was the beginning of the complete end of the occupation.”",
            "In remarks broadcast live by state radio and TV, he boasted of what he described as “great achievements” under the Taliban, such as an alleged end of corruption, improved security and banned poppy cultivation.",
            "On the eve of the anniversary, former Afghan President Ashraf Ghani defended what he said was a split-second decision to flee, saying he wanted to avoid the humiliation of surrender to the insurgents. He told CNN that on the morning of Aug. 15, 2021, with the Taliban at the gates of Kabul, he was the last one at the presidential palace after his guards had disappeared.",
            "Tomas Niklasson, the European Union’s special envoy to Afghanistan, said the bloc of nations remains committed to the Afghan people and to “stability, prosperity and sustainable peace in Afghanistan and the region.”",
            "“This will require an inclusive political process with full, equal and meaningful participation of all Afghan men and women and respect for human rights,” Niklasson wrote.",

            "ATLANTA (AP) — A federal judge on Monday said U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham must testify before a special grand jury in Atlanta that is investigating whether then-President Donald Trump and his allies broke any laws while trying to overturn his narrow 2020 general election loss in the state.",
            "Attorneys for Graham (R-S.C.) had argued that his position as a U.S. senator provided him immunity from having to appear before the investigative panel and asked the judge to quash his subpoena. But U.S. District Judge Leigh Martin May wrote in an order Monday that immunities related to his role as a senator do not protect him from having to testify. Graham’s subpoena instructs him to appear before the special grand jury on Aug. 23, but he is expected to appeal the judge’s ruling.",
            "Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis opened the investigation last year, and a special grand jury with subpoena power was seated in May at her request. Last month she filed petitions seeking to compel testimony from seven Trump advisers and associates.",
            "Prosecutors have indicated they want to ask Graham about phone calls they say he made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and his staff in the weeks following Trump’s election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.",
            "Graham had argued that a provision of the Constitution provides absolute protection against a senator being questioned about legislative acts. But the judge found there are “considerable areas of potential grand jury inquiry” that fall outside that provision’s scope. The judge also rejected Graham’s argument that the principle of “sovereign immunity” protects a senator from being summoned by a state prosecutor.",
            "Graham also argued that Willis, a Democrat, had not demonstrated extraordinary circumstances necessary to compel testimony from a high-ranking official. But the judge disagreed, finding that Willis has shown “extraordinary circumstances and a special need” for Graham’s testimony on issues related to alleged attempt to influence or disrupt the election in Georgia.",
            "May, the judge, last month rejected a similar attempt by U.S. Rep. Jody Hice, R-Ga., to avoid testifying before the special grand jury. Former New York mayor and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani had argued he couldn’t travel to Atlanta to testify because of health issues, but Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney, who’s overseeing the special grand jury, instructed him to appear on Wednesday.",
            "A Graham spokesperson, Kevin Bishop, said Monday the senator had no comment but referred to what Graham said when asked about the probe last week. During a news conference in Columbia, S.C., Graham said, “We will take this as far as we need to take it” when asked about his efforts to fight his subpoena.",
            "“I was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and had to vote on certifying an election,” Graham told reporters. “This is ridiculous. This weaponization of the law needs to stop. So I will use the courts. We will go as far as we need to go and do whatever needs to be done to make sure that people like me can do their jobs without fear of some county prosecutor coming after you.”",
            "In calls made shortly after the 2020 general election, Graham “questioned Secretary Raffensperger and his staff about reexamining certain absentee ballots cast in Georgia in order to explore the possibility of a more favorable outcome for former President Donald Trump,” Willis wrote in a petition.",
            "Graham also “made reference to allegations of widespread voter fraud in the November 2020 election in Georgia, consistent with public statements made by known affiliates of the Trump Campaign,” she wrote.",
            "Republican and Democratic state election officials across the country, courts and even Trump’s attorney general found there was no evidence of any voter fraud sufficient to affect the outcome of his 2020 presidential election loss.",

            "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — An Iranian government official denied on Monday that Tehran was involved in the assault on author Salman Rushdie, though he justified the stabbing in remarks that represented the Islamic Republic’s first public comments on the attack.",
            "The comments by Nasser Kanaani, the spokesman of Iran’s Foreign Ministry, came more than two days after the attack on Rushdie in New York. The writer has now been taken off a ventilator and is “on the road to recovery,” according to his agent.",
            "However, Iran has denied carrying out other operations abroad targeting dissidents in the years since the country’s 1979 Islamic Revolution, despite prosecutors and Western governments attributing such attacks back to Tehran. And while Iran hasn’t focused on the writer in recent years, a decades-old fatwa demanding his killing still stands.",
            "“Regarding the attack against Salman Rushdie in America, we don’t consider anyone deserving reproach, blame or even condemnation, except for (Rushdie) himself and his supporters,” Kanaani said.",
            "“In this regard, no one can blame the Islamic Republic of Iran,” he added. “We believe that the insults made and the support he received was an insult against followers of all religions.”",
            "Rushdie, 75, was stabbed Friday while attending an event in western New York. He suffered a damaged liver and severed nerves in an arm and an eye, his agent Andrew Wylie said. Rushdie was likely to lose the injured eye.",
            "His assailant, 24-year-old Hadi Matar, has pleaded not guilty to charges stemming from the attack through his lawyer.",
            "Rushdie has for more than 30 years faced death threats for “The Satanic Verses.” Iran’s late Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini had issued a fatwa, or Islamic edict, demanding his death. A semiofficial Iranian foundation had put up a bounty of over $3 million for the author, though it has yet to offer any comment on the attack.",
            "Police in New York have offered no motive yet for the attack, though District Attorney Jason Schmidt alluded to the bounty on Rushdie in arguing against bail during a hearing Saturday.",
            "“Even if this court were to set a million dollars bail, we stand a risk that bail could be met,” Schmidt said.",
            "Matar was born in the United States to parents who emigrated from Yaroun in southern Lebanon near the Israeli border, according to the village’s mayor. Flags of the Iranian-backed Shiite militant group Hezbollah, along with portraits of Hezbollah and Iranian leaders, hang across the village. Israel also has bombarded Hezbollah positions near there in the past.",
            "In Yaroun, village records show Matar holds Lebanese citizenship and is identified as a Shiite, an official there said. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of security concerns, said Matar’s father still lives there but has been in seclusion since the attack.",
            "In his remarks Monday, Kanaani added that Iran did not “have any other information more than what the American media has reported.” He also implied that Rushdie brought the attack on himself.",
            "“Salman Rushdie exposed himself to popular anger and fury through insulting the sacredness of Islam and crossing the red lines of over 1.5 billion Muslims and also red lines of followers of all divine religions,” Kanaani said.",
            "U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, while not directly blaming Tehran for the attack on Rushdie, made a point to mention Iran in a statement early Monday praising the writer’s efforts in supporting freedom of expression and religion.",
            "“Iranian state institutions have incited violence against Rushdie for generations, and state-affiliated media recently gloated about the attempt on his life,” Blinken said. “This is despicable.”",
            "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul condemned the attack on Rushdie at a lecture Sunday, saying that “a man with a knife cannot silence a man with a pen.”",
            "Khomeini, in poor health in the last year of his life after the grinding, stalemated 1980s Iran-Iraq war had decimated the country’s economy, issued the fatwa on Rushdie in 1989. The Islamic edict came amid a violent uproar in the Muslim world over the novel, which some viewed as blasphemously making suggestions about the Prophet Muhammad’s life.",
            "While fatwas can be revised or revoked, Iran’s current Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei — who took over after Khomeini — has never done so. As recently as February 2017, Khamenei said: “The decree is as Imam Khomeini issued.”",
            "Since 1979, Iran has targeted dissidents abroad in attacks. Tensions with the West — particularly the United States — have spiked since then-President Donald Trump unilaterally pulled America out of Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers in 2018.",
            "A Trump-ordered drone strike killed a top Iranian Revolutionary Guard general in 2020, further fueling those tensions.",
            "Last week, the U.S. charged a Guard member in absentia for allegedly plotting to kill one-time Trump adviser and Iran hawk John Bolton. Former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and an aide are under 24-hour security over alleged threats from Iran.",
            "Meanwhile, U.S. prosecutors say Iran tried to kidnap in 2021 an Iranian opposition activist and writer living in New York. In recent days, a man with an assault rifle was arrested near her home.",
            "Other denials from the Foreign Ministry have included Tehran’s transfer of weapons to Yemen’s Houthi rebels amid that country’s long civil war. Independent experts, Western nations and U.N. experts have traced weapon components back to Iran.",

            "Griner, a center for the Phoenix Mercury and a two-time Olympic gold medalist, was convicted on Aug. 4. She was arrested in February at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport after vape canisters containing cannabis oil were found in her luggage.",
            "Griner played for a women’s basketball team in Yekaterinburg during the WNBA offseason.",
            "Lawyer Maria Blagovolina was quoted by Russian news agencies on Monday as saying the appeal was filed, but the grounds of the appeal weren’t immediately clear.",
            "Blagovolina and co-counsel Alexander Boykov said after the conviction that the sentence was excessive and that in similar cases defendants have received an average sentence of about five years, with about a third of them granted parole.",
            "Griner admitted that she had the canisters in her luggage, but said she had inadvertently packed them in haste and that she had no criminal intent. Her defense team presented written statements that she had been prescribed cannabis to treat pain.",
            "Before her conviction, the U.S. State Department declared Griner to be “wrongfully detained.”",

            "Blinken didn’t elaborate, but The Associated Press and other news organizations have reported that Washington has offered to free Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer who is serving a 25-year sentence in the U.S. and once earned the nickname the “Merchant of Death.”",

The Russian side has long been seeking the release of Viktor Bout. The details should be left to professionals, proceeding from the ‘do not harm’ principle.’”"

            "CHICAGO (AP) — Jury selection begins Monday at R. Kelly’s federal trial in his hometown of Chicago, where the R&B singer faces charges that he rigged his 2008 state child pornography trial by threatening and paying off a girl who he allegedly filmed himself having sex with when he was around 30 and she was no older than 14.",
            "Jurors acquitted Kelly on all charges in that 2008 trial, some explaining later that they felt they had no choice because the girl did not testify. The woman, now in her 30s and referred to in filings only as “Minor 1,” will be the government’s star witness in the upcoming federal trial.",
            "Kelly, 55, goes into Chicago federal court Monday already sentenced by a New York federal judge to a 30-year prison term for a 2021 conviction on charges he used his fame to sexually abuse other young fans.",
            "Kelly, who rose from poverty on Chicago’s South Side to become a star singer, songwriter and producer, faces multiple charges at the federal trial. They include four counts of enticement of minors for sex — one each for four other accusers. They, too, are slated to testify.",
            "Convictions in Chicago could add decades to Kelly’s New York sentence, which he is appealing. With the New York sentence alone, Kelly will be around 80 before qualifying for early release.",
            "Two Kelly associates, Derrel McDavid and Milton Brown, are co-defendants at the Chicago trial. McDavid is accused of helping Kelly fix the 2008 trial, while Brown is charged with receiving child pornography. Like Kelly, they have also denied any wrongdoing.",
            "Two state cases are also still pending. One is a multiple count sex-abuse case out of Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago. The other is a solicitation case in Minnesota. No trial dates are set for either.",
            "Minor 1 is expected to testify that she was on video having sex with Kelly. The recording was at the heart of the monthlong 2008 trial and was played for jurors almost every day.",
            "Minor 1 first met Kelly in the late 1990s when she was in junior high school. She had tagged along to Kelly’s Chicago recording studio with her aunt, a professional singer working with Kelly. Soon after, Minor 1 told her parents Kelly was going to become her godfather.",
            "Prosecutors say Kelly later threatened and sought to pay off Minor 1 and her parents so they wouldn’t testify at the 2008 trial. None of them did.",
            "Double jeopardy rules bar the prosecution of someone for the same crimes they were acquitted of earlier. That doesn’t apply to the Chicago federal trial because prosecutors are alleging different crimes related to Minor 1, including obstruction of justice.",

            "JERUSALEM (AP) — A Palestinian gunman opened fire at a bus near Jerusalem’s Old City early Sunday, wounding eight Israelis in an attack that came a week after violence flared up between Israel and militants in Gaza, police and medics said.",
            "Two of the victims were in serious condition, including a pregnant woman with abdominal injuries and a man with gunshot wounds to the head and neck, according to Israeli hospitals treating them.",
            "The U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Tom Nides, tweeted that there were American citizens among the wounded. An embassy spokesperson disclosed no other information or details.",
            "The shooting happened as the bus waited in a parking lot near David’s Tomb on Mount Zion, just outside the Old City walls. Israeli media identified the suspected attacker as a 26-year-old Palestinian from east Jerusalem.",
            "Israeli police said forces were dispatched to the scene to investigate. Israeli security forces also pushed into the nearby Palestinian neighborhood of Silwan pursuing the suspected attacker.",
            "Later on Sunday, police said the suspected attacker turned himself in. Speaking at a meeting of his Cabinet on Sunday, Israeli Prime Mnister Yair Lapid said the suspected attacker was a resident of Jerusalem who was operating alone during the shooting and who had previously been arrested by Israel.",
            "In New York, friends and family of a father and son were relieved that their loved ones were recovering, even as worry surrounded the fate of a pregnant Brooklyn woman who was shot in the abdomen.",
            "“It’s very devastating and painful to see what’s happening,” said Rabbi Moishe Indig, a leader of the Satmar Jewish community in Brooklyn, who counted the father and son as members.",
            "The focus is on prayer and healing, said Isaac Abraham, a relative of the two.",
            "The attack in Jerusalem followed a tense week between Israel and Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.",
            "Last weekend, Israeli aircraft unleashed an offensive in the Gaza Strip targeting the militant group Islamic Jihad and setting off three days of fierce cross-border fighting. Islamic Jihad fired hundreds of rockets during the flare-up to avenge the airstrikes, which killed two of its commanders and other militants. Israel said the attack was meant to thwart threats from the group to respond to the arrest of one of its officials in the occupied West Bank.",
            "Forty-nine Palestinians, including 17 children and 14 militants, were killed, and several hundred were injured in the fighting, which ended with an Egyptian-brokered cease-fire. No Israeli was killed or seriously injured.",
            "The Islamic militant group Hamas, which controls Gaza, stayed on the sidelines.",
            "A day after the cease-fire halted the worst round of Gaza fighting in more than a year, Israeli troops killed three Palestinian militants and wounded dozens in a shootout that erupted during an arrest raid in the West Bank city of Nablus.",

            "NEW YORK (AP) — The Brad Pitt action film “Bullet Train” led all movies in ticket sales for a second straight weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday, while a quiet spell in theaters and incredible staying power allowed “Top Gun: Maverick” to rocket back into third place in its 12th week of release.",
            "After launching the previous weekend with about $30 million at the box office, “Bullet Train” pulled in $13.4 million in its second go-around. David Leitch’s assassin-crowded film, made for $90 million, has grossed $54.4 million in two weeks for Sony Pictures. Globally, “Bullet Train” has grossed $114.5 million.",
            "Three new films went into wide release but none cracked the top five films. The slowdown — an expected but still acute late-summer downturn in big releases — gave plenty of airspace for the year’s biggest movie, “Maverick,” to make another fly-by in theaters.",
            "Nearly three months after opening in May, Paramount Pictures put the “Top Gun” sequel back on a number of large-format screens and increased its theater count from 2,760 to 3,181. It came away with $7.2 million, bringing its cumulative total to $673.8 million. Paramount’s biggest smash ever, “Maverick” sits at seventh all-time in domestic box office, not accounting for inflation, right above “Titanic” and just below “Avengers: Infinity War.”",
            "The uncommonly long run for “Top Gun: Maverick” is even rarer at a time when studios have shrunk theatrical windows, typically sending movies to streaming services after about 45 days in theaters.",
            "“Top Gun: Maverick” was very narrowly edged for second place by Warner Bros.′ “DC League of Super-Pets.” Warner Bros. estimated Sunday that its animated movie took in $7.17 million in its third week of release, just a nose above the $7.15 million for “Maverick.” Final figures Monday should break the near-tie.",
            "But while “Top Gun: Maverick” has been a boon to theaters recovering from the pandemic, the thinly scheduled dog days of August — and potentially a chunk of September — will pose a test to the industry. This weekend, the biggest new film in nationwide theaters was A24′s “Bodies Bodies Bodies,” a Gen Z horror comedy that expanded to 1,269 locations after last week’s opening in limited release. It came in eighth with $3.3 million.",
            "Lionsgate’s “The Fall,” about two friends stranded atop a 2,000-foot radio tower, debuted with $2.5 million. Diane Keaton’s body-swap comedy “Mack & Rita” opened with just $1 million in ticket sales for Gravitas Ventures.",
            "In overall sales it was the lowest ticket-selling weekend of the summer. With few new wide releases on tap — including two Idris Elba titles: the safari thriller “Beast” (Aug. 19) and George Miller’s “Three Thousand Years of Longing” (Aug. 26) — moviegoing is likely to slow further in the coming weeks.",
            "Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.",
            "1. “Bullet Train,” $13.4 million.",
            "2. “DC League of Super-Pets,” $7.2 million",
            "3. “Top Gun: Maverick,” $7.2 million.",
            "4. “Thor: Love and Thunder,” $5.3 million.",
            "5. “Nope,” $5.3 million.",
            "6. “Minions: The Rise of Gru,” $4.9 million.",

            "8. “Bodies Bodies Bodies,” $3.3 million.",

            "CAIRO (AP) — A fire ripped through a packed Coptic Orthodox church during morning services in Egypt’s capital on Sunday, quickly filling it with thick black smoke and killing 41 worshippers, including at least 10 children.",
            "Several trapped congregants jumped from upper floors of the Martyr Abu Sefein church to try to escape the intense flames, witnesses said. “Suffocation, suffocation, all of them dead,” said a distraught witness, who only gave a partial name, Abu Bishoy.",
            "Sixteen people were injured, including four policemen involved in the rescue effort.",
            "The cause of the blaze at the church in the working-class neighborhood of Imbaba was not immediately known. An initial investigation pointed to an electrical short-circuit, according to a police statement.",
            "Weeping families waited outside for word about relatives still inside the church and at nearby hospitals where the victims were taken. Footage from the scene circulated online showed burned furniture, including wooden tables and chairs. Firefighters were seen putting out the blaze while others carried victims to ambulances.",
            "Witnesses said there were many children inside the four-story building, which had two day care facilities, when the fire broke out.",
            "“There are children, we didn’t know how to get to them,” said Abu Bishoy. “And we don’t know whose son this is, or whose daughter that is. Is this possible?”",
            "A hospital document obtained by The Associated Press said 20 bodies, including 10 children, were taken to the Imbaba public hospital. Three were siblings, twins aged 5 and a 3-year-old, it said. The church bishop, Abdul Masih Bakhit, was also among the dead at the hospital morgue.",
            "Twenty-one bodies were taken to other hospitals. It was not immediately known if children were among them.",
            "Mousa Ibrahim, a spokesman for the Coptic Orthodox Church, told the AP that 5-year-old triplets, their mother, grandmother and an aunt were among those killed.",
            "Witness Emad Hanna said a church worker managed to get some children out of the church day care facilities.",
            "“We went upstairs and found people dead. And we started to see from outside that the smoke was getting bigger, and people want to jump from the upper floor,” Hanna said.",
            "“We found the children,” some dead, some alive, he added.",
            "The country’s health minister blamed the smoke and a stampede as people attempted to flee the fire for causing the fatalities. It was one of the worst fire tragedies in Egypt in recent years.",
            "The church is located in a narrow street in one of the most densely populated neighborhoods in Cairo. Sunday is the first working day of the week, and traffic jams clog the streets in Imbama and surrounding areas in the morning.",
            "Some relatives criticized what they said were delays in the arrival of ambulances and firefighters. “They came after people died. … They came after the church burned down,” shouted one woman standing outside the smoldering church.",
            "Health Minister Khaled Abdel-Ghafar countered that the first ambulance arrived at the site two minutes after the fire was reported.",
            "Fifteen firefighting vehicles were dispatched to the scene to put out the flames while ambulances ferried casualties to nearby hospitals, officials said.",
            "President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi spoke by phone with Coptic Christian Pope Tawadros II to offer his condolences, the president’s office said. Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayeb, Al-Azhar’s Grand Imam, also offered condolences to the head of the Coptic church.",
            "“I am closely following the developments of the tragic accident,” el-Sissi wrote on Facebook. “I directed all concerned state agencies and institutions to take all necessary measures, and immediately to deal with this accident and its effects.”",
            "Abdel-Ghafar, the health minister, said in a statement that two of the injured were discharged from a hospital while the others were still being treated.",
            "The Interior Ministry said it received a report of the fire at 9 a.m. local time, and first responders found that the blaze had broken out in an air conditioner on the building’s second floor.",
            "The ministry, which oversees police and firefighters, blamed an electrical short-circuit for the fire, which produced huge amounts of smoke. Meanwhile, the country’s chief prosecutor, Hamada el-Sawy, ordered an investigation and a team of prosecutors were dispatched to the church. He said most victims died of smoke inhalation.",
            "By Sunday afternoon, emergency services said they managed to put out the blaze and the prime minister and other senior government officials arrived to inspect the site. Premier Mustafa Madbouly said surviving victims and families of the dead would receive payments as compensation and that the government would rebuild the church.",
            "By late afternoon, caskets carrying the dead were transferred in ambulances for pre-burial prayers at two churches in the nearby Waraq neighborhood, as weeping women lined their path.",
            "Egypt’s Christians account for some 10% of the nation’s more than 103 million people and have long complained of discrimination by the nation’s Muslim majority.",
            "Sunday’s blaze was one of the worst fire tragedies in recent years in Egypt, where safety standards and fire regulations are poorly enforced. In March last year, a fire at a garment factory near Cairo killed at least 20 people and injured 24."

            "MAYVILLE, N.Y. (AP) — Salman Rushdie is “on the road to recovery,” his agent confirmed Sunday, two days after the author of “The Satanic Verses” suffered serious injuries in a stabbing at a lecture in New York.",
            "The announcement followed news that the lauded writer was removed from a ventilator Saturday and able to talk. Literary agent Andrew Wylie cautioned that although Rushdie’s “condition is headed in the right direction,” his recovery would be long. Rushdie, 75, suffered a damaged liver and severed nerves in an arm and in an eye that he was likely to lose, Wylie had previously said.",
            "“Though his life changing injuries are severe, his usual feisty & defiant sense of humour remains intact,” Rushdie’s son Zafar Rushdie said in a Sunday statement that stressed the author remained in critical condition. The family statement also expressed gratitude for the “audience members who bravely leapt to his defence,” as well as police, doctors and “the outpouring of love and support.”",
            "Hadi Matar, 24, of Fairview, New Jersey, pleaded not guilty Saturday to attempted murder and assault charges in what a prosecutor called “a targeted, unprovoked, preplanned attack” at western New York’s Chautauqua Institution, a nonprofit education and retreat center.",
            "The attack was met with global shock and outrage, along with praise for the man who, for more than three decades — including nine years in hiding under the protection of the British government — has weathered death threats and a $3 million bounty on his head over “The Satanic Verses.”",
            "“It’s an attack against his body, his life and against every value that he stood for,” Henry Reese, 73, told The Associated Press. The cofounder of Pittsburgh’s City of Asylum was on stage with Rushdie and suffered a gash to his forehead, bruising and other minor injuries. They had planned to discuss the need for writers’ safety and freedom of expression.",
            "Authors, activists and government officials cited Rushdie’s bravery and longtime championing of free speech in the face of intimidation. Writer and longtime friend Ian McEwan labeled Rushdie “an inspirational defender of persecuted writers and journalists” and actor-author Kal Penn called him a role model, “especially many of us in the South Asian diaspora.”",
            "“Salman Rushdie — with his insight into humanity, with his unmatched sense for story, with his refusal to be intimidated or silenced — stands for essential, universal ideals,” U.S. President Joe Biden said in a Saturday statement. “Truth. Courage. Resilience. The ability to share ideas without fear.”",
            "Rushdie, who was born in India to a Muslim family and has lived in Britain and the U.S., is known for his surreal and satirical prose, beginning with his Booker Prize-winning 1981 novel “Midnight’s Children,” in which he sharply criticized then-Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.",
            "Infused with magical realism, 1988′s “The Satanic Verses” drew ire from some Muslims who regarded elements of the novel as blasphemy.",
            "They believed Rushdie insulted the Prophet Muhammad by naming a character Mahound, a medieval corruption of “Muhammad.” The character was a prophet in a city called Jahilia, which in Arabic refers to the time before the advent of Islam on the Arabian Peninsula. Another sequence includes prostitutes that share names with some of Muhammad’s nine wives. The novel also implies that Muhammad, not Allah, may have been the Quran’s real author.",
            "The book had already been banned and burned in India, Pakistan and elsewhere when Iran’s Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa, or edict, calling for Rushdie’s death in 1989. Khomeini died that same year, but the fatwa remains in effect — though Iran, in recent years, hadn’t focused on Rushdie.",
            "Iran’s state-run newspaper, Iran Daily, praised the attack as an “implementation of divine decree” Sunday. Another hardline newspaper, Kayhan, termed it “divine revenge” that would partially calm the anger of Muslims.",
            "Investigators were trying to determine whether the suspect, born nearly a decade after the novel’s publication, acted alone. A prosecutor alluded to the standing fatwa as a potential motive in arguing against bail.",
            "“His resources don’t matter to me. We understand that the agenda that was carried out yesterday is something that was adopted and it’s sanctioned by larger groups and organizations well beyond the jurisdictional borders of Chautauqua County,” District Attorney Jason Schmidt said.",
            "Schmidt said Matar got an advance pass to the event where the author was speaking and arrived a day early bearing a fake ID. The judge ordered Matar held without bail.",
            "Public defender Nathaniel Barone complained that authorities had taken too long to get Matar in front of a judge, leaving him “hooked up to a bench at the state police barracks,” and stressed that Matar had the right to presumed innocence.",
            "Barone said after the hearing that Matar has been communicating openly with him and that he would try to learn whether his clinet has psychological or addiction issues.",
            "Matar was born in the United States to parents who emigrated from Yaroun in southern Lebanon, village mayor Ali Tehfe told the AP. Flags of the Iran-backed Shia militant group Hezbollah, along with portraits of Hezbollah and Iranian leaders, were visible across Yaroun before journalists visiting Saturday were asked to leave.",
            "Hezbollah spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment. Lebanon’s top Shiite Mufti Sheikh Ahmad Kabalan vilified Rushdie in a speech Sunday without directly endorsing the attack, saying the author was “the cheapest and worst personality to deal with history and heritage by fabricating lies and hypocrisies.”",
            "In Tehran, some Iranians interviewed by the AP praised the attack on an author they believe tarnished the Islamic faith, while others worried it would further isolate their country.",
            "A state trooper and a county sheriff’s deputy were assigned to Rushdie’s lecture, and police said the trooper made the arrest. But afterward, some longtime visitors to the bucolic vacation colony questioned why there wasn’t tighter security given the history of threats against Rushdie.",
            "On Friday, an AP reporter witnessed the attacker stab or punch Rushdie about 10 or 15 times. Reese, the moderator, told CNN he initially thought the attack was a prank.",
            "News about the stabbing has led to renewed interest in “The Satanic Verses,” which topped bestseller lists after the fatwa was issued in 1989. As of Sunday morning, the novel ranked No. 11 on Amazon.com’s list.",
            "One of Rushdie’s ex-wives, the author and television host Padma Lakshmi, tweeted Sunday that she was “relieved” by Rushdie’s prognosis.",
            "“Worried and wordless, can finally exhale,” she wrote. “Now hoping for swift healing.”",

            "WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, the Arizona Democrat who single-handedly thwarted her party’s longtime goal of raising taxes on wealthy investors, received nearly $1 million over the past year from private equity professionals, hedge fund managers and venture capitalists whose taxes would have increased under the plan.",
            "For years, Democrats have promised to raise taxes on such investors, who pay a significantly lower rate on their earnings than ordinary workers. But just as they closed in on that goal last week, Sinema forced a series of changes to her party’s $740 billion election-year spending package, eliminating a proposed “carried interest” tax increase on private equity earnings while securing a $35 billion exemption that will spare much of the industry from a separate tax increase other huge corporations now have to pay.",
            "The bill, with Sinema’s alterations intact, was given final approval by Congress on Friday and is expected to be signed by President Joe Biden next week.",
            "Sinema has long aligned herself with the interests of private equity, hedge funds and venture capital, helping her net at least $1.5 million in campaign contributions since she was elected to the House a decade ago. But the $983,000 she has collected since last summer more than doubled what the industry donated to her during all of her preceding years in Congress combined, according to an Associated Press review of campaign finances disclosures.",
            "The donations, which make Sinema one of the industry’s top beneficiaries in Congress, serve a reminder of the way that high-power lobbying campaigns can have dramatic implications for the way legislation is crafted, particularly in the evenly divided Senate where there are no Democratic votes to spare. They also highlight a degree of political risk for Sinema, whose unapologetic defense of the industry’s favorable tax treatment is viewed by many in her party as indefensible.",
            "“From their vantage point, it’s a million dollars very well spent,” said Dean Baker, a senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a liberal-leaning think tank. “It’s pretty rare you see this direct of a return on your investment. So I guess I would congratulate them.”",
            "Sinema’s office declined to make her available for an interview. Hannah Hurley, a Sinema spokesperson, acknowledged the senator shares some of the industry’s views on taxation, but rebuffed any suggestion that the donations influenced her thinking.",
            "“Senator Sinema makes every decision based on one criteria: what’s best for Arizona,” Hurley said in a statement. “She has been clear and consistent for over a year that she will only support tax reforms and revenue options that support Arizona’s economic growth and competitiveness.”",
            "The American Investment Council, a trade group that lobbies on behalf of private equity, also defended their push to defeat the tax provisions.",
            "“Our team worked to ensure that members of Congress from both sides of the aisle understand how private equity directly employs workers and supports small businesses throughout their communities,” Drew Maloney, the organization’s CEO and president, said in a statement.",
            "Sinema’s defense of the tax provisions offer a jarring contrast to her background as a Green Party activist and self-styled “Prada socialist” who once likened accepting campaign cash to “bribery” and later called for “big corporations & the rich to pay their fair share” shortly before launching her first campaign for Congress in 2012.",
            "She’s been far more magnanimous since, praising private equity in 2016 from the House floor for providing “billions of dollars each year to Main Street businesses” and later interning at a private equity mogul’s boutique winery in northern California during the 2020 congressional recess.",
            "The soaring contributions from the industry to Sinema trace back to last summer. That’s when she first made clear that she wouldn’t support a carried interest tax increase, as well as other corporate and business tax hikes, included in an earlier iteration of Biden’s agenda.",
            "During a two-week period in September alone, Sinema collected $47,100 in contributions from 16 high-ranking officials from the private equity firm Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, records show. Employees and executives of KKR, another private equity behemoth, contributed $44,100 to Sinema during a two-month span in late 2021.",
            "In some cases, the families of private equity managers joined in. David Belluck, a partner at the firm Riverside Partners, gave a $5,800 max-out contribution to Sinema one day in late June. So did three of his college-age kids, with the family collectively donating $23,200, records show.",
            "“I generally support centrist Democrats and her seat is important to keep a Democratic Senate majority,” Belluck said, adding that his family has known Sinema since her election to Congress. “She and I have never discussed private equity taxation.”",
            "The donations from the industry coincide with a $26 million lobbying effort spearheaded by the investment firm Blackstone that culminated on the Senate floor last weekend.",
            "By the time the bill was up for debate during a marathon series of votes, Sinema had already forced Democrats to abandon their carried interest tax increase.",
            "“Senator Sinema said she would not vote for the bill .. unless we took it out,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters last week. “We had no choice.”",
            "But after private equity lobbyists discovered a provision in the bill that would have subjected many of them to a separate 15% corporate minimum tax, they urgently pressed Sinema and other centrist Democrats for changes, according to emails as well as four people with direct knowledge of the matter who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.",
            "“Given the breaking nature of this development we need as many offices as possible weighing in with concerns to Leader Schumer’s office,” Blackstone lobbyist Ryan McConaghy wrote in a Saturday afternoon email obtained by the AP, which included proposed language for modifying the bill. “Would you and your boss be willing to raise the alarm on this and express concerns with Schumer and team?”",
            "McConaghy did not respond to a request for comment.",
            "Sinema worked with Republicans on an amendment that stripped the corporate tax increase provisions from the bill, which a handful of vulnerable Democrats also voted for.",
            "“Since she has been in Congress, Kyrsten has consistently supported pro-growth policies that encourage job creation across Arizona. Her tax policy positions and focus on growing Arizona’s economy and competitiveness are longstanding and well known,” Hurley, the Sinema spokesperson, said.",
            "But many in her party disagree. They say the favorable treatment does little to boost the overall economy and argue there’s little compelling evidence to suggest the tax benefits are enjoyed beyond some of the wealthiest investors.",
            "Some of Sinema’s donors make their case.",
            "Blackstone, a significant source of campaign contributions, owns large tracts of real estate in Sinema’s home state, Arizona. The firm was condemned by United Nations experts in 2019 who said Blackstone’s financial model was responsible for a “financialization of housing” that has driven up rents and home costs, “pushing low-income, and increasingly middle-income people from their homes.”",
            "Blackstone employees executives and their family members have given Sinema $44,000 since 2018, records show.",
            "In a statement, Blackstone called the allegations by the U.N. experts “false and misleading” and said all employee contributions are “strictly personal.” The firm added that it was “incredibly proud of its investments in housing.”",
            "Another major financial services donor is Centerbridge Partners, a New York-based firm that buys up the debt of distressed governments and companies and often uses hardball tactics to extract value. Since 2017, Sinema has collected at least $29,000 from donors associated with the firm, including co-founder Mark Gallogly and his wife, Elizabeth Strickler, records show.",
            "In 2012, Centerbridge Partners purchased Arizona-based restaurant chain P.F. Chang’s for roughly $1 billion. After loading the struggling company up with $675 million of debt, they sold it to another private equity group in 2019, according to Bloomberg News. The company received a $10 million coronavirus aid loan to cover payroll, but shed jobs and closed locations as it struggled with the pandemic.",
            "Centerbridge Partners was also part of a consortium of hedge funds that helped usher in an era of austerity in Puerto Rico after buying up billions of dollars of the island government’s $72 billion debt — and filing legal proceedings to collect. A subsidiary of Centerbridge Partners was among a group of creditors who repeatedly sued one of the U.S. territory’s pension funds. In one 2016 lawsuit, the group of creditors asked a judge to divert money from a Puerto Rican pension fund in order to collect.",
            "A Centerbridge representative could not immediately provide comment Friday.",
            "Liberal activists in Arizona say they plan to make Sinema’s reliance on donations from wealthy investors a campaign issue when she is up for reelection in 2024.",
            "“There are many takes on how to win, but there is no universe in which it is politically smart to fight for favorable tax treatment of the wealthiest people in the country,” said Emily Kirkland, a political consultant who works for progressive candidates. “It’s absolutely going to be a potent issue.”",

            "MAYVILLE, N.Y. (AP) — The man accused in the stabbing attack on Salman Rushdie pleaded not guilty Saturday to attempted murder and assault charges in what a prosecutor called a “preplanned” crime, as the renowned author of “The Satanic Verses” remained hospitalized with serious injuries.",
            "An attorney for Hadi Matar entered the plea on his behalf during an arraignment in western New York. The suspect appeared in court wearing a black and white jumpsuit and a white face mask, with his hands cuffed in front of him.",
            "A judge ordered him held without bail after District Attorney Jason Schmidt told her Matar took steps to purposely put himself in position to harm Rushdie, getting an advance pass to the event where the author was speaking and arriving a day early bearing a fake ID.",
            "“This was a targeted, unprovoked, preplanned attack on Mr. Rushdie,” Schmidt said.",
            "Public defender Nathaniel Barone complained that authorities had taken too long to get Matar in front of a judge while leaving him “hooked up to a bench at the state police barracks.”",
            "“He has that constitutional right of presumed innocence,” Barone added.",
            "Matar, 24, is accused of attacking Rushdie on Friday as the author was being introduced at a lecture at the Chautauqua Institute, a nonprofit education and retreat center.",
            "Rushdie, 75, suffered a damaged liver and severed nerves in an arm and an eye, and was on a ventilator and unable to speak, his agent Andrew Wylie said Friday evening. Rushdie was likely to lose the injured eye.",
            "The attack was met with shock and outrage from much of the world, along with tributes and praise for the award-winning author who for more than 30 years has faced death threats for “The Satanic Verses.”",
            "Authors, activists and government officials cited Rushdie’s courage for his longtime advocacy of free speech despite the risks to his own safety. Writer and longtime friend Ian McEwan called Rushdie “an inspirational defender of persecuted writers and journalists across the world,” and actor-author Kal Penn cited him as a role model “for an entire generation of artists, especially many of us in the South Asian diaspora toward whom he’s shown incredible warmth.”",
            "President Joe Biden said Saturday in a statement that he and first lady Jill Biden were “shocked and saddened” by the attack.",
            "“Salman Rushdie — with his insight into humanity, with his unmatched sense for story, with his refusal to be intimidated or silenced — stands for essential, universal ideals,” the statement read. “Truth. Courage. Resilience. The ability to share ideas without fear. These are the building blocks of any free and open society.”",
            "Rushdie, a native of India who has since lived in Britain and the U.S., is known for his surreal and satirical prose style, beginning with his Booker Prize-winning 1981 novel “Midnight’s Children,” in which he sharply criticized India’s then-prime minister, Indira Gandhi.",
            "“The Satanic Verses” drew death threats after it was published in 1988, with many Muslims regarding as blasphemy a dream sequence based on the life of the Prophet Muhammad, among other objections. Rushdie’s book had already been banned and burned in India, Pakistan and elsewhere before Iran’s Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa, or edict, calling for Rushdie’s death in 1989.",
            "Khomeini died that same year, but the fatwa remains in effect. Iran’s current supreme leader, Khamenei, never issued a fatwa of his own withdrawing the edict, though Iran in recent years hasn’t focused on the writer.",
            "Investigators were working to determine whether the assailant, born a decade after “The Satanic Verses” was published, acted alone.",
            "District Attorney Schmidt alluded to the fatwa as a potential motive in arguing arguing against bail.",
            "“Even if this court were to set a million dollars bail, we stand a risk that bail could be met,” Schmidt said.",
            "“His resources don’t matter to me. We understand that the agenda that was carried out yesterday is something that was adopted and it’s sanctioned by larger groups and organizations well beyond the jurisdictional borders of Chautauqua County,” the prosecutor said.",
            "Authorities said Matar is from Fairview, New Jersey. He was born in the United States to Lebanese parents who emigrated from Yaroun in southern Lebanon, the mayor of the village, Ali Tehfe, told The Associated Press.",
            "Flags of Iran-backed Shia militant group Hezbollah and portraits of leader Hassan Nasrallah, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, his late predecessor Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and slain Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani are visible across the village, which also has a small Christian population.",
            "Journalists visiting the village Saturday were asked to leave. Hezbollah spokespeople did not respond to inquiries about Matar and the attack.",
            "Iran’s theocratic government and its state-run media assigned no motive for the attack. In Tehran, some Iranians interviewed by the AP praised the attack on an author they believe tarnished the Islamic faith, while others worried it would further isolate their country.",
            "An AP reporter witnessed the attacker stab or punch Rushdie about 10 or 15 times. Dr. Martin Haskell, a physician who was among those who rushed to help, described Rushdie’s wounds as “serious but recoverable.”",
            "Event moderator Henry Reese, 73, suffered a facial injury and was treated and released from a hospital, police said. He and Rushdie had planned to discuss the United States as a refuge for writers and other artists in exile.",
            "A state trooper and a county sheriff’s deputy were assigned to Rushdie’s lecture, and state police said the trooper made the arrest. But afterward some longtime visitors to the center questioned why there wasn’t tighter security given the threats against Rushdie and a bounty of more than $3 million on his head.",
            "The stabbing reverberated from the tranquil town of Chautauqua to the United Nations, which issued a statement expressing Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ horror and stressing that free expression and opinion should not be met with violence.",
            "Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
            "After the publication of “The Satanic Verses,” often-violent protests erupted across the Muslim world against Rushdie, who was born to a Muslim family and has long identified as a nonbeliever, once calling himself “a hardline atheist.”",
            "At least 45 people were killed in riots over the book, including 12 people in Rushdie’s hometown of Mumbai. In 1991, a Japanese translator of the book was stabbed to death and an Italian translator survived a knife attack. In 1993, the book’s Norwegian publisher was shot three times and survived.",
            "The death threats and bounty led Rushdie to go into hiding under a British government protection program, which included an around-the-clock armed guard. Rushdie emerged after nine years of seclusion and cautiously resumed more public appearances, maintaining his outspoken criticism of religious extremism overall.",
            "In 2012, Rushdie published a memoir about the fatwa titled “Joseph Anton,” the pseudonym Rushdie used while in hiding. He said during a New York talk that year that terrorism was really the art of fear.",
            "“The only way you can defeat it is by deciding not to be afraid,” he said.",
            "The Chautauqua Institution, about 55 miles (89 kilometers) southwest of Buffalo in a rural corner of New York, has served for more than a century as a place for reflection and spiritual guidance. Visitors don’t pass through metal detectors or undergo bag checks, and most people leave the doors to their century-old cottages unlocked at night.",
            "The center is known for its summertime lecture series, where Rushdie has spoken before.",
            "At a Friday evening vigil, a few hundred residents and visitors gathered for prayer, music and a long moment of silence.",

            "WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Laboratory tests following a mass dying off of fish detected high levels of salinity but no mercury in waters of Central Europe’s Oder River, Poland’s environment minister said Saturday.",
            "Anna Moskwa, the minister of climate and environment, said analyses of river samples taken in both Poland and Germany revealed the elevated salt levels. Comprehensive toxicology studies are still underway in Poland, she said.",
            "Writing on Twitter, Moskwa said test results transmitted from Germany had so far not shown a high presence of mercury.",
            "The Oder River runs from the Czech Republic, also known as Czechia, and along the border between Poland and Germany before flowing into the Baltic Sea. Some German media had reported that the river could be poisoned with mercury.",
            "Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said Friday that “huge amounts of chemical waste” were probably dumped intentionally into his country’s second-longest river, causing environmental damage so severe it would take years for the waterway to recover.",
            "On Saturday, Morawiecki vowed to do everything possible to limit the environmental devastation. Poland’s interior minister said a reward of 1 million zlotys ($200,000) would be paid to anyone who helps track down those responsible for polluting the river.",
            "Authorities in the northeastern German state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania warned people not to fish or use water from the Szczecin lagoon as the river’s contaminated water was expected to reach the estuary area Saturday evening.",
            "“The extent of the fish die-off is shocking. This is a blow to the Oder as a waterway of great ecological value, from which it will presumably not recover for a long time,” Alex Vogel, the environment minister for Germany’s Brandenburg state, along which the river runs.",
            "The head of Polish waters, Poland’s national water management authority, said Thursday that 10 tons of dead fish had been removed from the river. Hundreds of volunteers were working to help collect dead fish along the German side.",
            "German laboratories said they detected “atypical” levels of “salts” that could be linked to the die-offs but wouldn’t explain them on their own.",
            "Morawiecki acknowledged that some public officials were “sluggish” in reacting after huge numbers of dead fish were first seen floating and washing ashore.",
            "Two Polish officials were dismissed for what Morawiecki described as tardiness in their response. “If I come to the conclusion that there was a serious breach of duties, further consequences will be drawn,” the prime minister said.",
            "“For me, however, the most important thing is to deal with this ecological disaster as soon as possible, because nature is our common heritage. It is a national good,” Morawiecki said.",
            "His comments were echoed by Schwedt Mayor Annekathrin Hoppe, whose German town is located next to Lower Oder Valley National Park. She called the contamination of the river “an environmental catastrophe of unprecedented scale” for the region."

            "Watson, who is facing a potential year-long NFL suspension, spoke before Cleveland’s exhibition opener in Jacksonville — his first game since Jan. 3, 2021, with the Houston Texans.",
            "Watson was suspended six games earlier this month by independent arbiter Sue L. Robinson, who concluded he violated the league’s personal conduct policy with “egregious” and “predatory” behavior.",
            "As part of her decision, the retired federal judge noted Watson’s lack of remorse.",
            "Watson was asked in a pregame TV interview for his response to Robinson’s position that he hasn’t been contrite.",

            "Watson was accused of sexually harassing or assaulting the women during the therapy sessions in 2020 and 2021. He has always denied wrongdoing and grand juries in two Texas counties declined to indict him on criminal complaints.",
            "The three-time Pro Bowler settled 23 of 24 civil lawsuits.",
            "However, he’s still facing discipline from the league, which appealed Robinson’s penalty and is seeking a full-season ban along with a significant fine over $5 million and for Watson to undergo evaluation and treatment before he could be reinstated.",

            "PHOENIX (AP) — U.S. transportation officials announced $2.2 billion for local infrastructure projects on Thursday, paving the way for new bridges, roads, bike lanes, railways and ports in scores of communities across the country.",
            "The competitive grants are more than double the amount awarded the previous year under the same program. The influx comes from a $1 trillion infrastructure law backed by President Joe Biden, which provided an additional $7.5 billion over five years for the grants.",
            "Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said the projects would help modernize America’s transportation systems.",
            "“This is a program that recognizes many of the most interesting and compelling ideas and designs and plans aren’t going to come from Washington, but more of the funding should,” Buttigieg said. “That’s what we’re delivering here.”",
            "Buttigieg traveled to Arizona to highlight projects in Phoenix and Tucson, each of which are receiving the maximum $25 million. In Phoenix, the money will help build a new bike and pedestrian bridge over the Rio Salado, connecting the city’s southern area with downtown.",
            "In Tucson, the money will revamp a prominent street and replace a 1960s-era vehicle bridge that’s in poor condition. It also will add a separate bicycle and pedestrian bridge as part of what Mayor Regina Romero called “a transformative investment in Tucson’s infrastructure.”",
            "While the Tucson project will expand the number lanes for motorists, some projects elsewhere will reduce them. For example, a $17 million grant will help narrow a five-lane road to three lanes in the Chicago suburb of Munster, Indiana, in an effort to decrease traffic crashes. The money also will fund a 10-foot-wide multi-purpose path along the street and plant more than 250 trees.",
            "For many road improvement grants, “we’re doing it in mind of also benefitting the bike and pedestrian side,” Buttigieg said.",
            "Other newly announced projects in the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity program also provide funding for bicycle and pedestrian paths.",

Huntsville, Alabama, is getting $20 million to improve a pedestrian corridor linking downtown to isolated neighborhoods.

            "NEW YORK (AP) — The polio virus has been found in New York City’s wastewater in another sign that the disease, which hadn’t been seen in the U.S. in a decade, is quietly spreading among unvaccinated people, health officials said Friday.",
            "The presence of the poliovirus in the city’s wastewater suggests likely local circulation of the virus, the city and New York state health departments said.",
            "State Health Commissioner Dr. Mary T. Bassett said the detection of poliovirus in wastewater samples in New York City is alarming but not surprising.",
            "“The risk to New Yorkers is real but the defense is so simple — get vaccinated against polio,” New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan said in a statement. “With polio circulating in our communities there is simply nothing more essential than vaccinating our children to protect them from this virus, and if you’re an unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated adult, please choose now to get the vaccine. Polio is entirely preventable and its reappearance should be a call to action for all of us.”",
            "The announcement comes shortly after British health authorities reported finding evidence the virus has spread in London but found no cases in people. Children ages 1-9 in London were made eligible for booster doses of a polio vaccine Wednesday.",
            "In New York, one person suffered paralysis weeks ago because of a polio infection in Rockland County, north of the city. Wastewater samples collected in June in both Rockland and adjacent Orange County were found to contain the virus.",
            "Most people infected with polio have no symptoms but can still give the virus to others for days or weeks. Vaccination offers strong protection and authorities urged people who haven’t gotten the shots to seek one immediately.",
            "Based on past outbreaks, it is possible that hundreds of people in the state have gotten polio and don’t know it, officials said.",
            "Polio was once one of the nation’s most feared diseases, with annual outbreaks causing thousands of cases of paralysis. The disease mostly affects children.",
            "Vaccines became available starting in 1955, and a national vaccination campaign cut the annual number of U.S. cases to less than 100 in the 1960s and fewer than 10 in the 1970s, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
            "A small percentage of people who polio suffer paralysis. The disease is fatal for between 5-10% of those paralyzed.",

            "Democrats pulled off a fairly brilliant bit of marketing recently, rebranding their big domestic legislation (“Build Back Better”) into the smaller Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The new name is easier to understand, addresses voters’ driving economic worries and satisfied the needs of Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), whose support was crucial.",
            "The legislation is substantial. It’s the biggest federal investment in fighting climate change ever and the biggest change in Medicare since 2003. But when it comes to actually reducing inflation, as its name promises, budget experts say it leaves much to be desired.",
            "With the House set to pass it Friday and send it on to President Joe Biden for his signature, the bill will be one of the Democrats’ primary defenses on the campaign trail when they’re asked about what they did about rising prices. But Republicans have attacked the bill as actually doing little.",
            "“The country is running on Joe Biden and congressional Democrats’ record. It is a miserable record with a cruel economy, and nothing they’re going to do can change that because this will not tamp down inflation,” Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas) said Monday on Fox News.",
            "Brady’s concern found a sympathetic ear in the unlikely form of Senate Budget Committee chair Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who was frustrated that Democrats didn’t go further in their social agenda and push more ambitious legislation. During debate on the bill, which he ultimately voted for, Sanders went so far as to deride it as the “so-called Inflation Reduction Act.” The Republican National Committee even tweeted out video of Sanders’ remarks.",
            "The Penn Wharton Budget Model, a project of the University of Pennsylvania that aims to give Congressional Budget Office-type independent analyses of legislation, kicked off the criticism of the Inflation Reduction Act on July 29.",
            "It projected that the bill would actually boost inflation by 0.05 percentage point in 2024 and reduce it by 0.25 percentage point in “the late 2020s.”",
            "“These point estimates, however, are not statistically different than zero, thereby indicating a very low level of confidence that the legislation will have any impact on inflation,” according to the project’s analysis.",
            "The nonpartisan CBO came to a similar conclusion. In a preliminary analysis released Aug. 4, CBO Director Phillip Swagel wrote, “In calendar year 2022, enacting the bill would have a negligible effect on inflation, in CBO’s assessment,” and in 2023 inflation would probably be 0.1 percentage point lower or higher than if the law was unchanged.",
            "The key, Swagel said, would be how the bill would affect various economic factors that determine inflation, including demand, the supply of workers, supply chain disruptions and the reaction by the Federal Reserve.",
            "And though the head of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, Kent Smetters, and Swagel both served in the George W. Bush administration (and in Swagel’s case, also at the conservative American Enterprise Institute), their analyses have been seen as middle of the road.",
            "Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director at the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, told HuffPost in an email that the inflation effects “are likely to be small.”",
            "However, Goldwein said a side deal to loosen permitting restrictions on energy projects, such as pipelines and energy export facilities, would also help cut inflation.",
            "“But still, the effects are likely to be modest. And smaller in the final version of the bill than the original one,” he said.",
            "Democrats say those projections are too pessimistic and don’t give enough credit for the things the bill would do, like bring down prices on prescription drugs for seniors.",
            "“I think that this gives us a chance to cut a lot of costs, and that’s part of inflation,” Senate Finance Committee chair Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) told reporters when the bill was on the Senate floor.",
            "For example, he said, “as sure as night follows day,” private insurers will want to negotiate prices with drugmakers after they see how much Medicare will be able to save by doing so.",
            "“If you’re on the board of a private company and you look at what Medicare is doing, that board member will say to the CEO, ‘You better go get me that. Medicare is doing it — why can’t I have it?’” he said.",
            "The changes in the bill as it made it through the legislative process likely also reduced its effectiveness in something else Democrats have touted: cutting the budget deficit.",
            "The CBO initially scored the package as cutting more than $100 billion from the budget deficit over 10 years. For perspective, the last CBO baseline estimate projected $15.7 trillion in deficits over the next decade. CBO later revised down its estimate of the bill’s effect to about $90.5 billion before the Senate began its debating.",
            "CRFB’s Goldwein said the post-Senate version probably saw its deficit reduction cut even more, to somewhere around $70 billion.",
            "On Thursday, though, the CBO released a letter from Swagel saying the changes made since the bill’s unveiling, which would include a narrowing of the prescription drug negotiation provision and a swapping out of tax provisions to preserve the carried interest loophole, meant they could not give it a final score for “a few weeks.”",
            "Even if one includes the extra $200 billion in tax revenue the CBO says can be expected from stepped up enforcement ― which is prohibited from being in the formal score ― the effect on the deficit would be relatively small.",
            "But Goldwein said the bill was significant in how it had been pared back from a more expensive proposal last year with much more gimmicky pay-fors.",
            "“The Inflation Reduction Act, though not perfect, moves in the direction of deficit reduction ― something that hasn’t happened in a serious way since 2011 (or 2013 relative to ‘current policy’),” he said."

            "NEW YORK (AP) — The nation’s top public health agency on Thursday relaxed its COVID-19 guidelines, dropping the recommendation that Americans quarantine themselves if they come into close contact with an infected person.",
            "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also said people no longer need to stay at least 6 feet away from others.",
            "The changes are driven by a recognition that — more than 2 1/2 years since the start of the pandemic — an estimated 95% of Americans 16 and older have acquired some level of immunity, either from being vaccinated or infected, agency officials said.",
            "“The current conditions of this pandemic are very different from those of the last two years,” said the CDC’s Greta Massetti, an author of the guidelines.",
            "The CDC recommendations apply to everyone in the U.S., but the changes could be particularly important for schools, which resume classes this month in many parts of the country.",
            "Perhaps the biggest education-related change is the end of the recommendation that schools do routine daily testing, although that practice can be reinstated in certain situations during a surge in infections, officials said.",
            "The CDC also dropped a “test-to-stay” recommendation, which said students exposed to COVID-19 could regularly test — instead of quarantining at home — to keep attending school. With no quarantine recommendation anymore, the testing option disappeared too.",
            "Masks continue to be recommended only in areas where community transmission is deemed high, or if a person is considered at high risk of severe illness.",
            "School districts across the U.S. have been scaling back their COVID-19 precautions in recent weeks even before the CDC relaxed its guidance.",
            "Masks will be optional in most school districts when classes resume this fall, and some of the nation’s largest districts have dialed back or eliminated COVID-19 testing requirements.",
            "Some have also been moving away from test-to-stay programs that became unmanageable during surges of the omicron variant last school year. With so many new infections among students and staff, many schools struggled to track and test their close contacts, leading to a temporary return to remote classes in some places.",
            "The average numbers of reported COVID-19 cases and deaths have been relatively flat this summer, at around 100,000 cases a day and 300 to 400 deaths.",
            "The CDC previously said that if people who are not up to date on their COVID-19 vaccinations come into close contact with a person who tests positive, they should stay home for at least five days. Now the agency says quarantining at home is not necessary, but it urges those people to wear a high-quality mask for 10 days and get tested after five.",
            "The agency continues to say that people who test positive should isolate from others for at least five days, regardless of whether they were vaccinated. CDC officials advise that people can end isolation if they are fever-free for 24 hours without the use of medication and they are without symptoms or the symptoms are improving.",

            "A jury found Ahmad Abouammo guilty on six charges: two counts of money laundering; two counts of wire fraud or conspiracy to commit wire fraud; a count on destruction, alteration or falsification of records; and a final count on acting as a foreign agent for the Saudis without notice, according to The New York Times.",
            "Abouammo, a dual citizen of the U.S. and Lebanon, worked at the San Francisco-based social media platform from 2013 to 2015 as a media partnerships manager responsible for the Middle East and North Africa region.",
            "During that time, Abouammo shared confidential details with a close adviser to the crown prince about Twitter users whose accounts either criticized or were embarrassing to the Saudi royal family and the kingdom. This information included personal email addresses and telephone numbers, according to the indictment.",
            "In exchange for his services, Abouammo received a watch worth at least $20,000 from the Saudis but failed to act in accordance with Twitter’s policy requiring employees to notify their manager and the vice president of human resources for any gift exceeding $100, and then return it.",
            "The Saudi adviser also transferred $100,000 into a Lebanese bank account linked to Abouammo’s family.",
            "Abouammo resigned from Twitter in May 2015 but received an additional $200,000 in the following eight months for facilitating Saudi requests.",
            "Prior to his resignation, Abouammo introduced Ali Alzabarah — another defendant named in the investigation and a Saudi citizen who worked for Twitter — to the Saudi official who also helped the kingdom with its requests.",
            "Abouammo was arrested in Seattle in 2019.",
            "Alzabarah reportedly fled to Saudi Arabia after he was confronted by Twitter and placed on administrative leave following his unauthorized work for the Saudis.",
            "Despite its poor human rights record, which has drawn the condemnation of multiple U.S. officials, Saudi Arabia continues to insert itself into American life. Last month, former President Donald Trump’s New Jersey golf course hosted a controversial Saudi-sponsored golf tournament. The tournament has been criticized as “sport washing” for the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamaal Khashoggi and the Saudis’ involvement in the 9/11 attacks.",
            "U.S. intelligence agencies said the crown prince, often referred to as MBS, was behind the operation to kill Khashoggi.",
            "Survivors and families of the victims of 9/11 called on Trump to refuse to host the tournament following an FBI investigation that revealed several contacts and phone calls between Saudi officials and the terrorists behind the 9/11 attacks.",
            "President Joe Biden visited the kingdom in July and gave the crown prince a fist bump despite previously claiming he would only talk to King Salman.",
            "Prior to traveling to Saudi Arabia, Biden wrote a rare opinion piece for the Washington Post explaining the reasons behind his trip.",
            "“A more secure and integrated Middle East benefits Americans in many ways. Its waterways are essential to global trade and the supply chains we rely on,” Biden wrote.",

            "But some photos of him should never be seen, his widow says, and she’s seeking unspecified millions in compensation for snapshots taken of the NBA star’s corpse that were circulated after he was killed in a helicopter crash with their daughter and seven others in 2020.",
            "Vanessa Bryant’s invasion of privacy trial against the Los Angeles County sheriff’s and fire departments begins Wednesday in a U.S. District Court just over a mile from where Kobe Bryant played most of his career with the Lakers.",
            "Vanessa Bryant claims deputies did not take the photos for investigative purposes and shared them with firefighters who responded to the crash scene. The lawsuit said a deputy showed the photos to bar patrons and a firefighter showed them off-duty colleagues.",
            "“Mrs. Bryant feels ill at the thought that sheriff’s deputies, firefighters, and members of the public have gawked at gratuitous images of her deceased husband and child,” according to the lawsuit. “She lives in fear that she or her children will one day confront horrific images of their loved ones online.”",
            "Kobe Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna, and other parents and players were flying to a girls basketball tournament when their chartered helicopter crashed in the Calabasas hills west of Los Angeles in fog. Federal safety officials blamed pilot error for the wreck.",

            "The calls for transparency came quickly after Monday’s FBI raid of Mar-A-Lago, the home and social club of former President Donald Trump in Palm Beach, Florida.",
            "Trump supporters in elected office demanded explanations from the Justice Department for the unprecedented search of the home of a former president ― and potential electoral rival for the sitting president.",
            "“Why are the FBI and DOJ refusing to comment after raiding the private home of a former U.S. President?” Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), a staunch Trump ally, wrote on Twitter. “The American people demand transparency — they do not want another political witch hunt of President Trump.”",
            "Even Republicans who opposed Trump wanted more details ― why was Mar-A-Lago raided? And why was it raided now? ― out of the agency, often arguing the unprecedented move required the Justice Department to put aside standard procedure.",
            "“These are unprecedented circumstances that require unprecedented transparency and accountability from our government institutions,” said Maryland GOP Gov. Larry Hogan, a frequent critic of Trump who is considering a 2024 presidential bid. “The American people deserve to know all the facts as soon as possible, and I call on the Biden administration to release ― at a minimum ― the documents authorizing the FBI search.”",
            "The Justice Department, however, is sticking to its strict rules against discussing ongoing investigations, amid recent experiences seeing how violations of those rules can quickly create unintended consequences. The calls for transparency are likely to go unanswered, at least in the short-term.",
            "But there is someone who is free to provide more information: Trump. While Trump was not at Mar-A-Lago during the raid, FBI agents would have supplied one of his lawyers and employees with both a search warrant outlining the justification for the search and an inventory of everything agents ultimately seized. The former president is free to release those documents.",
            "Some details have leaked out, both from Trump and from unnamed sources with knowledge of the investigation. Trump said the FBI broke into his safe, for instance, and multiple news outlets have reported the search dealt with an investigation into Trump’s decision to remove 15 boxes of White House documents, some of them classified, and bring them to Mar-A-Lago rather than with the Justice Department’s investigation into the Jan. 6 insurrection.",
            "Tim Purdon, a former U.S. Attorney for North Dakota during the Obama administration, explained the Justice Department’s relative silence this way: Imagine the opposite scenario.",
            "“Let’s say Merrick Garland had appeared at a press conference at the gates of Mar-A-Lago and told the American people all of the evidence that made up the probable cause warrant in this case,” Purdon said. “Many, many people would say ‘How dare the AG, the Justice Department go on and say they have this evidence without filing an indictment? They’re taking away the defendant’s right to a fair trial.’”",
            "Purdon’s imagined reaction does reflect the bad faith in which many Republican elected officials were certain to deploy if the Justice Department moved against Trump. But what about Trump opponents like Hogan, who feel an unprecedented step requires unprecedented disclosures and explanations? Purdon says they likely won’t have to wait for long.",
            "“This seems to be the sort of investigatory, law enforcement action you take not at the beginning of an investigation, but very close to the end of an investigation,” Purdon said. “So who’s to say that the government is not going to speak and be transparent sometime in the short term here?”",
            "And recent history shows the pratfalls of breaking from that policy: Former FBI Director James Comey, trying to maintain his independence from the Justice Department under then-President Barack Obama, repeatedly spoke out regarding the agency’s investigation into the Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. The famous “Comey letter,” released weeks before the 2016 election, may have tipped the election to Trump.",
            "After Trump fired Comey, now-FBI Director Christopher Wray said at his confirmation hearing he would not release derogatory information about suspects, satisfying both Democrats angry at the FBI’s treatment of Clinton and Republicans frustrated with leaks regarding the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russia.",
            "In the meantime, however, some Democrats ― who did not want to openly comment on an investigation they know little about ― are fretting that the silence from the FBI and Justice Department could be filled with misinformation generated by Trump and his allies. That’s part of the reason why some Democrats have begun calling on Trump to release the warrant and inventory from the search, a step he’s so far declined to take.",
            "“Donald Trump has a copy of the search warrant. He’d show us the warrant if he were so wronged,” Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) wrote on Twitter. “Show it or shut it.”",
            "Whenever the public does learn more about the search ― both its cause and results ― Purdon is confident the Justice Department made the right move.",
            "“The top folks at DOJ are not exactly riverboat gamblers,” he said. “This has to be the most scrutinized search warrant in the history of the Justice Department.”"

            "A judge last month had ordered Giuliani, a Trump lawyer and former New York City mayor, to appear before the special grand jury Tuesday.",
            "But Giuliani’s attorney, Robert Costello, told The Associated Press on Monday that Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney, who’s overseeing the special grand jury, had excused Giuliani for the day.",
            "Nothing in publicly available court documents indicates that Giuliani is excused from appearing, but McBurney has scheduled a hearing for 12:30 p.m. Tuesday to hear arguments on a court filing from Giuliani seeking to delay his appearance. In a court filing Monday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis asked the judge to deny Giuliani’s request for a delay and to instruct him to appear before the special grand jury as ordered.",
            "Willis opened an investigation early last year, and a special grand jury with subpoena power was seated in May at her request.",
            "Last month she filed petitions seeking to compel testimony from seven Trump advisers and associates, including Giuliani. Because they don’t live in Georgia, she had to use a process that involves getting a judge in the state where they live to order them to appear.",
            "New York Supreme Court Justice Thomas Farber on July 13 issued an order directing Giuliani to appear before the special grand jury on Aug. 9 and on any other dates ordered by the court in Atlanta.",
            "Giuliani’s legal team last week asked Willis’ office to delay his appearance, saying he was unable to travel because of a medical procedure. That request was rejected after Willis’ team found evidence on social media that he had traveled since his medical procedure.",
            "A Giuliani attorney then clarified to Willis’s team that Giuliani is not cleared for air travel, but Willis still refused to postpone his appearance, the motion says.",
            "In her Monday court filing, Willis wrote that her team had obtained records indicating that between July 19 and July 21, Giuliani bought multiple airline tickets, including tickets to Rome, Italy, and Zurich, Switzerland, for travel dates between July 22 and July 29. Willis said her team offered to provide alternative transportation — including bus or train fare — if Giuliani wasn’t cleared for air travel.",
            "Giuliani had also offered to appear virtually, for example by Zoom, his motion says.",
            "“It is important to note here that Mr. Giuliani is no way seeking to inappropriately delay, or obstruct these proceedings or avoid giving evidence or testimony that is not subject to some claim of privilege in this matter,” the motion says, noting that Giuliani had appeared virtually before the committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and testified for more than nine hours.",
            "“Mr. Giuliani is willing to do the same here under conditions that replicate a grand jury proceeding,” the motion says.",
            "In the petition for Giuliani’s testimony, Willis identified him as both a personal attorney for Trump and a lead attorney for his campaign.",
            "She wrote that he and others presented a Georgia state Senate subcommittee with a video recording of election workers that Giuliani alleged showed them producing “suitcases” of unlawful ballots from unknown sources, outside the view of election poll watchers.",
            "Within 24 hours of that hearing on Dec. 3, 2020, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger’s office had debunked the video and said that it had found that no voter fraud had taken place at the site. Nevertheless, Giuliani continued to make statements to the public and in subsequent legislative hearings claiming widespread voter fraud using that debunked video, Willis wrote.",
            "Evidence shows that Giuliani’s appearance and testimony at the hearing “was part of a multi-state, coordinated plan by the Trump Campaign to influence the results of the November 2020 election in Georgia and elsewhere,” the petition says."

You’re like, ‘I’m Idris, I need to be on that Jay-Z album.’”",

And I sent it to him and we got this text back from Jay saying, ‘Um, I don’t love this — I fucking love it.’”",
            "The spoken verse had Elba expound on the elements of “gangsterment” in the voice of Angel Wood, the unscrupulous drug dealer who fatally underestimates Denzel Washington’s character of Frank Lucas in the film. Jay-Z, clearly smitten by the reading, sampled it for the “Intro” track of his album.",
            "“Your gangster is not defined by how low your jeans fall by your waist, but more how your genes stand up to their expectations,” Elba says in the cut. “Your gangster is not defined by how many rocks are in your watch, but rather how many rocks you move while owning the watch.”",
            "Elba also appeared on Paul McCartney’s 2021 album “McCartney III Reimagined” and has a thriving music career himself. He served as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding DJ, but appears plenty proud of his Billboard feats with the iconic Beatle and his hip-hop idol.",

            "SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — A federal judge in California has ruled three golfers who joined Saudi-backed LIV Golf will not be able to compete in the PGA Tour’s postseason.",
            "Judge Beth Labson Freeman made her decision Tuesday afternoon in San Jose after attorneys for the sides each spoke for about an hour. Freeman said she didn’t consider the golfers faced irreparable harm because of the big money they were guaranteed by joining LIV, a key issue in the case.",
            "“There simply is no irreparable harm in this case,” PGA Tour attorney Elliot Peters said.",
            "The three suspended golfers were seeking a temporary restraining order, which Freeman denied. Talor Gooch, Matt Jones and Hudson Swafford claimed they should be able to play where they want to, each saying in letters last month to the PGA, “I am a free agent and independent contractor.” They are among 10 players who filed an antitrust lawsuit against the PGA Tour last week — including Phil Mickelson.",
            "Robert Walters, an antitrust litigator representing the golfers, noted it is their opportunity on a big playoff stage, “effectively the Super Bowl of golf” because of its “significant income opportunities.” Freeman responded that the LIV Tour earnings potential was also great and asked whether players might have been able to wait until the conclusion of the PGA Tour season to depart for the new tour.",
            "Walters argued there were only 48 spots and they would have filled according to LIV Golf CEO Greg Norman, to which Freeman said she agreed with that stance but that the golfers stood to gain far more financially joining LIV than the money they might have earned on the PGA Tour.",
            "“This is an extraordinarily attractive financial opportunity but it’s much more than that,” Walters said, saying the harm done is that “players lose intangible benefits” such as qualifications for the major tournaments as well as other marquee invitationals.",
            "“This is the holy grail because everybody wants to compete in and prevail in major championships, but it’s not just the majors,” Walters said. He noted that the PGA Tour inferred these golfers would put a “taint” or “stench” on the tour’s image by playing.",
            "The first of three FedEx Cup playoff events begin Thursday as players compete for the $18 million top prize — thus the urgency for Freeman to rule. This case could go to trial next year, with the possibility of an injunction hearing in late September or early October, according to Peters.",
            "Peters said lifting the suspensions of the golfers and allowing them to play would “change the status quo” for the PGA Tour and “give them a fabulous platform” to promote the LIV tour while competing in a PGA event.",
            "“I think it’s a huge problem,” he said. “... The Commissioner needs the ability to protect the tour. This is a very dire situation for the Tour.”",
            "Gooch (No. 20), Jones (No. 65) and Swafford (No. 67) are among nine players who have joined LIV Golf and finished the regular season among the top 125 in the FedEx Cup standings. The other six who joined LIV Golf are not asking to play in the tour’s postseason.",

            "The vote was taken at a league meeting at a hotel in Minnesota, where Walton, his daughter, Carrie Walton Penner, and her husband, Greg Penner, were introduced to the media by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. With an estimated worth of $60 billion, Walton — the eldest son of Walmart founder Sam Walton — becomes the wealthiest owner in the league.",
            "Walton’s group paid the highest price in history for a sports franchise anywhere in the world. His three limited partners are Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton, Starbucks board chair Mellody Hobson and former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. All three investors are Black, satisfying an NFL goal to bring more racial diversity into ownership groups, front offices and coaching staffs.",
            "The Pat Bowlen Trust ran the franchise after Bowlen stepped back from day-to-day duties in 2014 because of Alzheimer’s disease. He died in 2019, one month before his induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.",
            "Bowlen wanted one of his children to take over the team and Brittany Bowlen, now 32, was the trustees’ selected successor. Not all of her siblings supported that choice, so the club was put up for sale. Brittany Bowlen stepped down as the team’s vice president of strategy after the Walton-Penner group was awarded the franchise with their winning bid.",

I know there has been an amazing history here, and you can learn a lot from history — the good, the bad, and everything,” new coach Nathaniel Hackett said “Right now, it is just about putting ourselves in a position to win some football games.”",

The new deal for the nine-time Pro Bowl pick is expected to be in the range of $260 million and five years.",
            "Another pressing issue: assessing the stadium situation. Though Empower Field at Mile High is only 21 years old, it lacks the frills and revenue-producing features of new venues like SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles and Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, home of the AFC West rival Chargers and Raiders.",

            "A new book claims that former President Donald Trump verbalized his disdain for wounded veterans early on in his presidency.",
            "The authors of “The Divider: Trump in the White House, 2017-2021,” The New York Times’ Peter Baker and The New Yorker’s Susan B. Glasser, detailed an exchange Trump had with his then-chief of staff John Kelly in which the former president expressed interest in copying the grandeur he witnessed during a French military parade. He just wanted to make one key tweak, according to an excerpt published by The New Yorker.",
            "In 2017, Trump flew to Paris for Bastille Day celebrations held by Emmanuel Macron, the then-new French president. The celebration was also meant to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the American entrance into the WWI. Due to this, Macron apparently wanted to appeal to Trump’s love for opulence with a grandiose military display, which included vintage tanks rolling down the Champs-Élysées as fighter jets flew overhead.",
            "When Trump returned to Washington, D.C., he asked his generals to throw him an even showier military parade for July 4. Part of his vision for improving on France’s spectacular martial display was apparently by barring veterans who were wounded or used a wheelchair from his parade.",
            "“Look, I don’t want any wounded guys in the parade,” Trump allegedly told Kelly, noting with “distaste” that visibly injured veterans were featured in the French parade. “This doesn’t look good for me.”",
            "Kelly — a retired Marine Corps general — was apparently flabbergasted by the idea.",
            "“Those are the heroes,” Kelly told Trump, according to the book. “In our society, there’s only one group of people who are more heroic than they are — and they are buried over in Arlington.”",
            "The book noted that Kelly did not mention that his son, Robert — a lieutenant killed in action in Afghanistan — was among those buried in Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.",
            "“I don’t want them,” Trump apparently repeated. “It doesn’t look good for me.”",
            "Trump — who dodged the Vietnam War draft — has a history of disrespecting veterans, especially those who have died or have been injured.",
            "In 2020, The Atlantic reported that Trump referred to American service members who died in WWI as “losers” and “suckers” in conversations with his senior staff during a trip to France in 2018.",
            "While on the trip, he turned down a planned visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery ― a WWI cemetery in Belleau, France, near the site of the Battle of Belleau Wood. His reason was reportedly because the cemetery was “filled with losers.” In another conversation during the trip, he “referred to the more than 1,800 marines who lost their lives at Belleau Wood as ‘suckers’ for getting killed,” The Atlantic reported.",
            "Former White House spokesperson Alyssa Farah told HuffPost at the time that the Atlantic’s report was “false.”",
            "“President Trump holds the military in the highest regard. He’s demonstrated his commitment to them at every turn: delivering on his promise to give our troops a much needed pay raise, increasing military spending, signing critical veterans reforms and supporting military spouses,” Farah said.",
            "Trump also famously criticized the late Sen. John McCain, who was held for over five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.",
            "“He’s not a war hero,” Trump said in 2015 of McCain. “I like people who weren’t captured.”"

            "Graham directly addressed Hassan, calling her actions “deceitful” and “dishonest,” during a debate on repealing a tax on foreign oil.",
            "“This gives phony and cynical a bad name,” Graham snapped in a video shared by Forbes. (Watch it below.) “They wouldn’t let you do this in professional wrestling. If you think people are this dumb, you are gonna be sadly mistaken.”",
            "Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), the presiding officer, called out Graham for attacking the motives of a fellow senator and for directly addressing Hassan instead of through the chair and with third-person references.",

            "Hassan, along with 49 other Democratic senators, voted against Graham’s proposal to remove a tax on foreign oil, then proposed a similar amendment that required more votes ― and would never have gotten enough support, even with Hassan and a few Democrats joining all the Republican senators.",
            "“What she’s doing is trying to strike the provisions that she just voted against but it requires 60 votes,” Graham griped, per NH Journal. “So she can vote for repealing a gas tax she just voted against so she’ll look good for the voters. If you really wanted to repeal the gas tax, the new one indexed to inflation, you should have voted for my amendment,” Graham said.",

            "WASHINGTON ― In an odd spectacle on Sunday, Senate Democrats argued among themselves and overwhelmingly voted against one of their own top policy priorities before coming together to pass one of the landmark bills of Joe Biden’s presidency.",
            "Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) tried to amend the bill to include an extension of the monthly child allowance that Democrats enacted on a temporary basis last year, but couldn’t continue due to opposition from Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.).",
            "“Pathetically, the United States has the highest child poverty rate of almost any major country on Earth,” Sanders said. “Unfortunately for the millions of working parents who benefited from this program, it expired in December.”",
            "Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Michael Bennet (D-Col.), two of the strongest proponents of the child tax credit, rose in opposition to Sanders’ amendment ― not because they didn’t like it, but because its adoption would have jeopardized the cheaper prescription drugs and billions for green energy promised by the Inflation Reduction Act.",
            "“I ask my great colleagues to vote no because this will bring the bill down,” Brown said.",
            "Nevertheless, Sanders persisted, asking Brown to explain how the child tax credit would harm the broader bill. Brown said that all 50 Senate Democrats supported the legislation and suggested that adding the child tax credit would cost them their unanimity.",
            "“We know that this is a fragile arrangement, and we’ve got to pass it,” Brown said.",
            "As the Senate’s presiding officer explained Brown’s time was up, the gravelly-voiced Ohio Democrat could be heard on C-SPAN grumbling about his colleague: “Come on, Bernie,” he said.",
            "The Sanders amendment then failed by a vote of 97 to 1 ― one of dozens of amendments rejected by the Senate.",
            "The expanded child tax credit Democrats created in 2021 paid parents as much as $300 per child each month. For six months, the credit dramatically reduced child poverty and gave American parents a taste of the kind of child allowance that for decades has been a standard part of the welfare state in other rich countries.",
            "But Manchin complained that parents in his state wasted the money on drugs, and refused to go along with a bill continuing the benefit as part of the “Build Back Better” agenda after 2021.",
            "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) continued negotiating with Manchin on the parts of Build Back Better that he could support, such as investments in green energy and allowing Medicare to negotiate prescription drugs, and their talks ultimately resulted in the Senate passing the Inflation Reduction Act on Sunday.",
            "Bennet said Sunday he would work with “people on both sides of the aisle” to make the enhanced child tax credit permanent, but it remains to be seen whether a critical mass of Republicans would ever support a monthly allowance for parents.",
            "Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) has proposed a different version of the Democrats’ child tax credit with the cost of the program offset by consolidating and eliminating other safety net programs, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. Romney’s proposal would also exclude benefits for parents with no incomes, likely blunting some of its antipoverty impact.",
            "Romney has had informal conversations with Bennet and Brown and said he thought more formal negotiations could begin after the Senate’s August recess. He also said he thought he could win over more than the two Republicans who had signed on to his proposal so far.",
            "“We’re not in a big hurry,” Romney told HuffPost. “We anticipate that this will probably be a number of months before something like this gets adopted.”",
            "The White House has “shown interest” in his proposal, Romney said, but he didn’t know if President Biden would support it. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.",
            "It’s not clear how much energy there will be to strike another bipartisan deal after senators previously collaborated on gun control and subsidies for the domestic computer chip industry. Republicans may prefer to avoid giving Biden another legislative victory ahead of midterm elections that could boost their ranks in the House and Senate.",
            "Romney wouldn’t say if he thought the overturning of Roe v. Wade, and the loss of abortion access for millions of women, would spur more Republicans to support parents.",
            "“I think it’s important for our party to talk about not just poverty but about family and encouraging helping families that are having children,” Romney said."

            "You’ve been having a wonderful summer in the great outdoors, and now you’ve gotten an invitation to an event that calls for something skimpy and slinky. But when you start getting dressed, you notice vast swaths of previously covered-up skin that stand out in blinding contrast to your more tanned bits. Perhaps, right as you’re strapping on a lovely new pair of sandals, you see a line where your socks end. Or maybe your face has pale sections left that sunglasses and ball caps once shielded. And, oh, how those spaghetti straps show off your white shoulders and tanned forearms, with a short-sleeve DMZ separating them.",
            "What can you do — fast — to fix the situation, and how can you avoid it in the future? Our experts are here to help. And, as it turns out, they’ve felt your pain.",
            "“I live in Australia, so there are lots of very harsh tan lines on people here,” said Michelle Wong, the cosmetic chemist behind the popular blog Lab Muffin. “When I was in school, I always had a sock tan. And I’ve also had some really strong tan lines in summer where I’ve forgotten to reapply sunscreen.”",
            "“I’ve experienced farmer’s tans personally, and I’ve seen prominent tan lines on models that I’ve had to correct during photo shoots,” said celebrity makeup artist Jamie Dorman. “It’s a problem that can be hard to fix in post-production and can be even more glaring in photos.”",
            "Even if you’ve managed to escape a farmer’s tan personally, tan lines can still happen to those you love. “I tell my husband to wear his SPF and reapply, but after a day of sun exposure in the backyard or on the boat, he has a noticeable tan line on his lower neck and arms,” said Joie Tavernise, aesthetician and brand founder of JTAV Clinical Skincare. “It makes me cringe.”",
            "Emergency fix No. 1: foundation makeup (the best option)",
            "For Dorman, foundation is the most effective and the quickest solution. But before you even get started with foundation, you’ll want to exfoliate. “I recommend beginning by exfoliating the body part you’re going to put makeup on, even the parts that won’t need makeup, to create an even-textured surface and make blending easier,” Dorman said. “You might find that a chemical exfoliant is gentler than a scrub, and lotion is a good choice for dry skin. I like Paula’s Choice Skin Revealing Body Lotion 10% AHA.”",
            "Which foundation to use? “I recommend color-matching foundation to the color of your tan with body makeup. I like Westmore Beauty Body Coverage Perfector,” Dorman said. “It has a natural appearance, and it sets in place for all-day wear. I also recommend their body coverage mitt to make application even and to keep makeup from getting under your nails.”",
            "Emergency fix No. 2: Self-tanner (this one’s a bit tougher to get right)",
            "If you want something more lasting, consider self-tanner, although it does have its critics. “I once tried to even out a farmer’s tan with sunless tanner,” Dorman said. “It ended up looking ridiculous, because the shade of the sunless tanner was different from the shade of my tan.”",
            "If you want to give it a try, your first decision is: All over, or just on the pale spots? “You can try using it all over to try to make the contrast less obvious, but a more effective method is to just apply fake tan to the light areas,” Wong said. “If you don’t go to a professional spray tanner, you can try it yourself with a mitt or a makeup brush, if you’re up for the challenge. But be aware that this can be a bit tricky if the color doesn’t match your natural tan or if the lines are quite complex. Make sure you exfoliate the area first with a gentle scrub so you get an even finish. Keep the skin dry until it has a chance to absorb the tanner.”",
            "Prevention for next time",
            "“Prevention is better than trying to fix it afterward, since tans can take a long time to fade,” Wong said. “Remember to reapply sunscreen regularly when you’re in the sun. You can set an alarm to help remind you, and sun-protective clothing is a good option, too.”",
            "Tavernise shared ideas for products you’ll be more likely to reapply: “In my bag, I always have a powder sunscreen. It’s like a high-performance SPF and absorbs oil on the face without feeling heavy, and it’s great for touch-ups during the day. In my car, I keep a mineral sunscreen mist and spray for reapplication on my décolletage, arms and hands. I love sunscreen sticks and buy them for my dad, who is out all day in the sun, to keep in his pocket.”"

            "The Senate failed to cap sky-high prices for insulin on sunday as part of the Democrats’ climate and health legislation.",
            "A majority voted for it ― 57 senators ― but it wasn’t enough under the Senate’s 60-vote rule for passage.",
            "Yet just a few hours later, the Senate successfully protected subsidiaries of private equity companies from a new 15% corporate minimum tax rate included in the legislation.",
            "It received the same number of votes as the insulin cap amendment, but this time the Senate rules required only a simple majority to pass it.",
            "The difference in fate between the two votes, both of which received support from same-sized majorities, shows how the Senate’s arcane and frequently arbitrary rules often add to an already malapportioned legislative body’s bias toward powerful interests. People with diabetes looking for help to afford lifesaving medication need a supermajority, while a simple majority is just fine for private equity managers looking to protect their fruitful investments.",
            "Most Democrats, up to a somewhat reluctant President Joe Biden, have been prepared to scrap or severely weaken the filibuster rule, the extra-constitutional provision requiring 60 votes to end debate in the Senate that has come to function as a supermajority requirement for almost all legislation. But Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) have blocked any attempted reforms.",
            "The combined effect of Senate rules is to create additional chokepoints for interest groups to exploit. It’s not a coincidence that every major piece of economic legislation passed through the Senate during Biden’s administration had the backing of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which represents America’s largest and most powerful businesses, until Sunday’s passage of the so-called Inflation Reduction Act.",
            "The bill raises taxes on investors and large corporations, and spends the cash reducing the deficit and investing in clean energy and health care subsidies, while also giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs. The House is expected to pass the legislation and send it to Biden later this week.",
            "Passing the bill on a party-line vote in the 50-50 Senate meant Democrats were relying on what’s called budget reconciliation. But reconciliation requires every provision of the bill to have a direct and substantial effect on the federal budget, making it useless for many social policies and any economic ones without a direct effect on federal taxation or spending.",
            "The provision to cap insulin prices would have limited co-pays for insulin at $35 a month for people on private health insurance plans. But the Senate’s parliamentarian, an unelected official accountable only to members of the upper chamber, ruled it fell outside of what’s allowed under reconciliation.",
            "That meant the GOP could challenge it, and Democrats would need to round up 10 Republicans to keep it in the bill. Seven Republicans, all representing states with large swatches of rural poverty, joined Democrats: Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan of Alaska, John Kennedy and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Josh Hawley of Missouri and Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi. But it wasn’t enough.",
            "Insulin prices have spiked in recent years, and Americans pay as much as 10 times more than what the drug costs in other economically developed countries. Four-fifths of diabetics who take insulin say the cost of the drug causes them financial hardship.",
            "“This won’t just save money, it will save lives,” Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said on the floor before the vote. “This should not be a hard vote to cast.”",
            "The legislation still limits insulin co-pays to $35 a month for people who use Medicare, and Democrats have promised a stand-alone vote on legislation sponsored by Republican Susan Collins and Democrat Jeanne Shaheen (N.H.) to keep costs low. But unless three additional Republicans are willing to back the legislation, it will fail under the Senate’s 60-vote threshold.",
            "Two of the world’s largest drug companies, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, have been some of the biggest beneficiaries of rising insulin costs. Since the beginning of Democratic control of Congress in 2021, the two companies have spent massive sums lobbying against cost controls: Eli Lilly has spent $11.4 million, according to federal lobbying records, while Novo Nordisk has spent $5.8 million.",
            "The private equity amendment, on the other hand, was backed by a powerful industry with a powerful ally in Sinema, who had already forced Democrats to strip out an effort to tighten a loophole abused by the industry. The Arizona freshman feared the minimum tax would hit small- and medium-sized businesses with private equity backing, with a spokesman saying her goal was to “target tax avoidance, make the tax code more efficient, and support Arizona’s economic growth and competitiveness.”",
            "Other Democrats said Sinema’s concerns were nonsensical: Unless the businesses had more than $1 billion in revenue, they would be untouched.",
            "“I don’t know very many small businesses at home that have a profit of a billion dollars a year,” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, told reporters on Saturday night. “This is a very small number of businesses.”",
            "Still, with Sinema’s support and the amendment’s passage assured, six other Democrats facing potentially tough reelection battles in coming years – Mark Kelly of Arizona, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff of Georgia, Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire ― voted for it, hoping to avoid the industry’s wrath in the future.",
            "Though Sunday’s dueling votes provided a clear example, the powerful have long abused Senate rules. When senators were still chosen by state legislatures in the 1800s, wealthy men often bribed local officials to gain entrance to the chamber, a practice that culminated in Montana in 1899, when two mining magnates each spent $1 million on bribes hoping to win a Senate election. In the first half of the 20th century, Southern senators filibustered every single attempt at civil rights legislation.",
            "In more recent years, decisions by Democrats and Republicans to eliminate the filibuster for judicial and executive branch nominations has meant Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell could enact much of his agenda ― passing tax cuts and appointing judges ― with a simple majority, while more complicated Democratic goals, on issues from gun control to health care to voting rights, still require 60-vote pledges.",
            "As recently as December 2021, the Senate listened to cries of panic from business leaders and passed a one-time exception to the filibuster to raise the debt limit with fewer than 60 votes.",
            "The Senate is already far from a paragon of democracy: It grants states with small populations wildly disproportionate power over American politics, giving the typical rural American 37% more power than the average voter when it comes to determining control of the Senate. Small states are also far less racially diverse than bigger ones, meaning the typical Black voter has 17% less influence over who controls the Senate than an average voter, and a typical Hispanic voter has 33% less influence.",
            "The filibuster exacerbates the bias toward smaller states: The six senators who represent California, New York and Texas represent the same number of people as the 62 senators who represent the union’s 31 smallest states, more than enough to sustain a filibuster.",
            "Senate rules also weaken the federal government’s hands when it comes to combating state and local governments who abuse their powers: While GOP-controlled states passed a wave of voting rights restrictions this year, Democratic plans to pass legislation overriding them at the federal level were stymied by Manchin’s and Sinema’s insistence on protecting the filibuster.",

            "The “Bullet Train” debut for Sony Pictures was solid but unspectacular for a movie that cost $90 million to make and was propelled by Pitt’s substantial star power.

            "While late summer is always a quiet period in theaters, it will be especially so this year — and likely to sap some of the momentum stirred by “Top Gun: Maverick,” “Jurassic World: Dominion,” “Minions: The Rise of Gru” and others. After a comeback season that pushed the box office close to pre-pandemic levels, it’s about to get pretty quiet in cinemas.",
            "“It’s definitely going to be quieter, like the calm after the storm,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore. “But that doesn’t mean there’s not going to be great movies out there and perhaps the good will generated by some of those films might be enough to buoy the box office until we get into the blockbuster corridor with ‘Black Panther: Wakanda Forever’ and ‘Avatar 2’ down the road. We have to expect that we’re not going to be able to keep up the pace we had this summer.”",
            "As the last big summer movie to leave the station, “Bullet Train” hopes to keep riding for the coming weeks. That would be in line with the playbook of some other original, August-released summer movies like “Free Guy” and “Crazy Rich Asians.” Directed by David Leitch (“Atomic Blonde,” “Deadpool 2”), “Bullet Train” gathers a number of assassins (co-stars include Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry) together on a speeding train running from Tokyo to Kyoto.",
            "As one of the few original would-be summer blockbusters without big-name intellectual property behind it, the R-rated “Bullet Train” might have come into the weekend with more momentum if reviews had been stronger. With a low 54% fresh rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes, “Bullet Train” was only slightly better received by audiences, who gave the film a B+ CinemaScore. The film added $32.4 million in overseas box office.",
            "The weekend’s other new wide release, “Easter Sunday,” struggled to catch on. The Universal Pictures comedy, starring comic Jo Koy as an actor attending his family’s Easter Sunday celebration, won praise for its Filipino representation but drew even worse reviews than “Bullet Train.” It opened with $5.3 million in ticket sales.",
            "Instead, “Bullet Train” was trailed by a number of holdovers, including Warner Bros.′ “DC League of Pets.” The animated release grossed $11.2 million in its second week of release.",
            "Jordan Peele’s “Nope,” the Universal sci-fi horror release, continued to perform well, earning $8.5 million in its third weekend. With $98 million in tickets sold, “Nope” will soon surpass $100 million at the domestic box office.",
            "Taika Waititi’s “Thor: Love and Thunder,” for the Walt Disney Co., came in fourth with $7.6 million in its fifth weekend. It’s now up to $316.1 million, making it the highest grossing Thor movie domestically. With $699 million globally, “Love and Thunder” is less likely to catch the $854 million worldwide haul of 2017′s “Thor: Ragnarok.”",
            "In limited release, A24′s “Bodies Bodies Bodies” launched on six screens in New York and Los Angeles with $226,525 in ticket sales, good for a per-screen average of $37,754. The horror comedy about rich 20-somethings at a remote house party, with a cast including Amandla Sternberg, Maria Bakalova and Pete Davidson, expands nationwide on Friday.",
            "Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Tuesday.",
            "1. “Bullet Train,” $30.1 million.",
            "2. “DC League of Super Pets,” $11.2 million.",
            "3. “Nope,” $8.5 million.",

            "Notably, it was also reported last week that Warner Bros. Discovery had canceled its “Batgirl” movie, which had finished shooting and was slated to be released on HBO Max. “Batgirl” was to star Leslie Grace ― who, unlike Miller, has not been embroiled in multiple scandals ― in the title role.",

            "HAVANA (AP) — Cuban firefighters were joined by special teams sent by Mexico and Venezuela on Sunday as they battled for a second day to control a fire blazing at a big oil tank farm in the western province of Matanzas.",
            "The blaze began Friday night when lightning struck a storage tank during a thunder storm, and the fire spread to a second tank early Saturday, triggering a series of explosions, officials have said.",
            "“The mission of the day is to keep the third tank cold,” in hopes of preventing the flames from spreading into more of the site, provincial Gov. Mario Sabines said.",
            "Most of the fuel held in the tank where the fire initially started was believed to have been consumed, officials said.",
            "Authorities said a body found at the site Saturday had been identified as firefighter Juan Carlos Santana, 60. Officials previously said a group of 17 firefighters had gone missing while trying to quell flames, but there was no word if he was one of those.",
            "Conditions were still too dangerous to mount a search for the missing firefighters, officials said.",
            "A total of 122 people were treated for injuries, including five that officials said were in critical condition.",
            "The governor said 4,946 people had been evacuated, mostly from the Dubrocq neighborhood, which is next to the Matanzas Supertanker Base in Matanzas city. The facility’s eight huge storage tanks hold oil used to fuel electricity generation.",
            "Dense black smoke billowed up from the tank farm and spread westward more than 100 kilometers (62 miles) to Havana. The Ministry of Science and Technology said Sunday that the cloud contained sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and other toxic substances.",
            "The disaster comes as Cuba struggles with a severe economic and energy crisis, with frequent power blackouts hitting during a torrid summer. It was unknown how much fuel had been lost to the flames.",
            "Cuba’s government had appealed for help Saturday from oil nations, and specialized firefighting teams began arriving with their equipment from Mexico and Venezuela late Saturday. They brought helicopters and specialized chemicals for fighting oil fire.",
            "“The support (is) in the prevention of risks and also help to quell the fire by means of cooling based on water and foam,” Mexican Brig. Gen. Juan Bravo said upon arrival. “We hope that more support will arrive soon, such as chemical material.”",
            "President Miguel Díaz-Canel met with the heads of the teams from Mexico and Venezuela to coordinate efforts for controlling the blaze. He later told Cuban media he appreciated the help, since Cuba doesn’t have experience or resources for dealing with fires of such magnitude.",
            "Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Fernández de Cossío said Saturday evening that the U.S. government had offered technical help. On his Twitter account, he said the “proposal is in the hands of specialists for the due coordination.”",

            "FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — The National Weather Service extended a flood watch through Sunday evening for areas of eastern Kentucky ravaged by high water more than a week ago and said there’s a threat of thunderstorms in the region for much of the coming week.",
            "There’s a “persistent threat of thunderstorms” through Thursday that could produce heavy rain and cause flash flooding “especially if multiple storms pass over the same area,” the weather service in Jackson said.",
            "The forecast includes Monday, when President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden are scheduled to join Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and his wife, Britainy, at a Federal Emergency Management Agency State Disaster Recovery Center in eastern Kentucky to survey the damage and meet with those affected.",
            "The biggest concern is the possibility of slow-moving storms on Tuesday and Wednesday, which could dump heavy rain on already saturated soil, National Weather Service meteorologist Philomon Geertson said.",
            "“It is a wet and juicy pattern that could cause at least some more isolated to scattered instances of flash flooding and further complicate the recovery efforts that are ongoing at this time,” he said.",
            "Some relief is expected toward the end of the week, Geertson said.",
            "“It does look like high pressure will finally build in and we’ll get a reprieve from this really wet and muggy air mass that we’ve been dealing with for a couple of weeks now,” he said.",
            "Meanwhile, the federal government on Saturday promised more aid for flood-ravaged eastern Kentucky. Biden authorized an increase in the level of federal funding for emergency work and FEMA added five counties to those eligible for individual assistance for a total of 12.",
            "“This is good news and will be a big help,” Beshear said in a tweet Sunday after visiting the day before with some displaced residents who are staying at state parks since the catastrophic flooding.",
            "“These Kentuckians have been through the unimaginable. My priority is being there for them,” he said.",
            "At least 37 people lost their lives in the flooding after 8 to 10 1/2 inches (20 to 27 centimeters) of rain fell in just 48 hours in the Appalachian mountain region. The flooding also hit areas just across the state line in Virginia and West Virginia.",
            "The National Weather Service said radar-based rainfall estimates suggesting that 14 to 16 inches of rain fell from July 26-29, totals that are “historically unheard of.”",
            "More than 1,300 people were rescued in the days after the storm as teams searched in boats and combed debris-clogged creekbanks. Work crews were still trying to restore power and water connections as residents look to repair their homes and lives after the floods.",
            "Power outages were down to 300 on Sunday, Beshear tweeted. The number of fatalities stood at 37, but Kentucky State Police reported at least two people were still missing.",
            "“The devastation is enormous. We will be there for our Eastern Kentucky neighbors in the weeks, months and years ahead,” Beshear said."

            "Little did Mulvenna know that Harrelson himself would catch wind of the tweet and publicly respond to the spitting image on Instagram. The Oscar-nominated actor not only screenshotted Mulvenna’s tweet, but wrote four lines of poetry for her daughter — titled “Ode to Cora.”",
            "“Ode to Cora,” Harrelson captioned his Instagram post. “You’re an adorable child / Flattered to be compared / You have a wonderful smile / I just wish I had your hair.”",

And although the condition eventually forced her to leave the workforce and move from California to be with family in Michigan, she has remained active ― volunteering with MS advocacy groups, participating in church activities ― with the help of medication that slows the disease’s progression and reduces the severity of symptoms.",
            "But the treatment is expensive, and McRipley’s drug coverage, through Medicare, leaves her on the hook for hundreds of dollars, and sometimes more than a thousand dollars, in out-of-pocket costs when she fills the prescriptions at the pharmacy. Paying is a real struggle on a fixed income, McRipley told HuffPost in an interview, but going without the medication isn’t an option, as she discovered the hard way this summer, when she stopped taking some of her pills briefly and within a week started losing mobility, dexterity and her sense of balance.",
            "“I lost my ability to even hold a fork or a spoon to eat ― it was like night and day,” McRipley said.",
            "McRipley has resumed taking the medication, but, as is often the case with relapsing and remitting forms of MS, she fears she will never get back to where she was. And although McRipley can’t be sure the medication pause is the reason her condition got worse, she is sure about how the cost of her drugs affects her life even when she’s able to take them.",
            "“It’s really upsetting because I have to ask for assistance, for things like groceries,” McRipley said. “I’m asking my parents … and I should be in a position where I’m helping them at this time, not the other way around.”",
            "McRipley’s story is by no means unusual or limited to people with MS. High cost also appears to discourage Medicare beneficiaries with cancer, hepatitis C and certain immune disorders from taking their medications, according to a major paper that appeared in the journal Health Affairs earlier this year. And it wasn’t the first study to document such effects.",
            "Democrats have been promising to help people like McRipley, and they may be on the verge of fulfilling that promise with the Inflation Reduction Act, which party leaders hope to pass in the coming days and send to President Joe Biden for his signature. The legislation includes several provisions designed to reduce what people pay at the pharmacy counter. The best-known and most controversial of these would give the federal government power to negotiate the prices of drugs that Medicare covers, which is something that the governments of other economically advanced countries already do and a big reason why pharmaceutical prices in those nations are so much lower than they are here.",
            "But only a limited number of drugs would be subject to negotiation under a process that wouldn’t lead to lower prices for those drugs until 2026. Even then, drug prices in the U.S. would likely remain significantly higher than they are in peer countries, which means that Medicare beneficiaries like McRipley would still need more help, ideally sooner rather than later.",
            "And they may get it. The other prescription drug reforms of the Inflation Reduction Act have gotten a lot less attention, but several could have a big impact, including one that would put a hard limit on out-of-pocket drug expenses. It would phase in over two years, starting in 2024, so that by 2025, beneficiaries like McRipley would pay no more than $2,000 a year for drugs that now cost them many times more than that.",
            "McRipley said the provision could be a “lifesaver,” which, if the studies are correct, is literally true. But that all depends on the bill actually passing. As of this writing, that is still no sure thing.",
            "Medicare Beneficiaries Have Drug Coverage ― With Big Gaps",
            "The story of why Medicare beneficiaries owe so much for prescriptions goes back to 2003, when President George W. Bush signed the law that created Medicare’s drug benefit, which is known as Part D. The program addressed a huge need. Prior to that, Medicare beneficiaries frequently couldn’t find drug coverage.",
            "But the program’s chief architects were Republicans and conservative Democrats who refused to give the federal government leverage over drug prices and weren’t willing to spend what it would take to finance the kind of comprehensive benefit many seniors needed. As a result, Part D has big gaps in its coverage, exposing seniors to significant deductibles, copayments and coinsurance.",
            "The Affordable Care Act, which President Barack Obama signed in 2010, addressed the problem partly by gradually eliminating one of the big gaps in coverage ― or closing the “doughnut hole,” as it had come to be known. The 2018 Bipartisan Budget Act, which President Donald Trump signed, accelerated the process.",
            "But even with those reforms fully in place, Medicare beneficiaries remain responsible for a fraction of their drug costs with no limit on the total.",
            "The portion is small, just 5% once drug spending reaches a certain threshold. But some drugs have such high list prices ― tens, even hundreds of thousands of dollars a year ― that the 5% becomes punishing, enough to deter patients from taking the drugs altogether.",
            "“I think there is this perception that just because someone is on Medicare, they’re covered and most of their prescription drug costs and other kinds of costs are covered,” said Amy Niles, executive vice president of the PAN Foundation, which provides financial assistance to people who can’t afford their medical bills. “But when it comes to prescription medications, that’s not the case. So for people on Medicare … there is no limit to what you might pay out of pocket for these medications.”",
            "Sometimes People Skip Medications They Need",
            "The study that appeared in Health Affairs earlier this year shows just how severe the effects can be. Among Medicare beneficiaries who weren’t eligible for extra government assistance, nearly 1 in 3 were failing to fill the new prescriptions, researchers found.",
            "“We know that these are critically important drugs, many of them the first-line treatment recommendation,” Vanderbilt associate professor and lead author Stacie Dusetzina told HuffPost. “So these aren’t optional for people. These are what you need to extend your life or to prevent you from getting sicker. The fact that it’s nearly 1 in 3, that is just mind-blowing.”",
            "Not all drugs that Medicare beneficiaries need translate to such high individual costs. It’s mainly the drugs that individual beneficiaries purchase directly at pharmacies using their Part D coverage. Infusions and other drugs they get at doctor’s offices and clinics usually fall under Medicare Part B, which pays for outpatient services, and the cost-sharing in Part B is typically much lower because most beneficiaries have supplemental coverage or out-of-pocket limits on medical spending.",
            "To illustrate the illogic of that distinction, Dusetzina has cited the example of breast cancer.",
            "The treatment for one common type, known as HER2-negative cancer, is a drug that people take orally. For Medicare beneficiaries, annual out-of-pocket costs can exceed $10,000. The treatment for a different variant, HER2-positive breast cancer, is an infusion, which for most Medicare beneficiaries will cost a fraction of that amount.",
            "“It means you might be feeling lucky that you have a cancer that’s treated with infusions instead of pills,” Dusetzina said. “It makes no sense at all.”",
            "Charities Provide Critical Help, But It’s Not Enough",
            "Joan Durnell Powell doesn’t need a study to tell her about the high cost of drugs and the choices it forces upon patients. Powell is a retiree in California who in 2014 got a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes, a class of blood disorders. The medications she’s taken have kept her alive, she said in an interview, but with out-of-pocket costs that run into four and frequently five figures.",
            "Like many Medicare beneficiaries, Powell has gotten help from several private charities, including the PAN Foundation, that assist people who can’t afford their drugs. “If it wasn’t for the support of these foundations, I literally wouldn’t be living.” But sometimes the grants expire or the paperwork doesn’t get through, Powell said, and even when the money is there, it covers only some of the bills.",
            "Today, she said, she still has to come up with about $5,000 to $6,000 a year ― on a fixed annual income of less than $30,000. “Anytime I tell people about this, I say I don’t have to worry about my disease. I have to worry about my co-pay.”",
            "The limits on what the charities can provide are why those organizations have lined up with Patients for Affordable Drugs, FamiliesUSA and other health care advocacy groups to support the proposed out-of-pocket cap. They are equally enthusiastic about some related provisions in the Democratic legislation, including a proposed expansion of support for Medicare beneficiaries with low incomes.",
            "The Reform Package Has Real Tradeoffs",
            "Like all policy proposals, the Democratic legislation comes with some trade-offs, which, in the case of the out-of-pocket cap and the low-income assistance, is primarily in the form of new government spending.",
            "In other words, the reason Medicare beneficiaries like McRipley and Powell would soon pay less for their drugs under the Democratic proposal is that the federal government would be assuming more of the financial burden directly.",
            "That helps explain why those two provisions are part of the same bill that calls for government negotiation of drug prices. The negotiation and some related provisions of the legislation would reduce Medicare spending because as the prices of individual drugs came down, Medicare wouldn’t have to lay out as much money for them.",
            "The drug industry and its allies, including Republicans and some Democrats, have warned that forcing down drug prices would reduce drug company profits, making it harder for them to attract the investment capital they need to finance the research and development of new drugs. Potentially that could mean fewer breakthrough drugs, as in the kind that now treat McRipley’s MS and Powell’s blood disorder.",
            "But analysts at the Congressional Budget Office have said they think the Democratic bill would likely have only a small effect on innovation. And while plenty of researchers think the effects could be larger, Dusetzina is among a large group that thinks the CBO got it right.",
            "“I think the bill does a nice job of finding a balance ― putting in guardrails around what drugs are eligible for negotiation and also targeting only a small number of drugs to start,” Dusetzina said. “So the pharma industry’s claims related to the loss of cures, I think, are dramatically overstated.”",
            "Of course, the proposal won’t have any effect on innovation ― or on drug prices ― if the Inflation Reduction Act doesn’t get through Congress. And though all 50 senators in the Democratic caucus have now said they support the bill, clearing the way for passage, the drug industry is making one last, desperate push to break up the coalition.",
            "A lot is riding on the outcome. For some Medicare beneficiaries, it might even be a matter of life or death."

            "If Donald Trump runs for president a third time, Republicans on Capitol Hill will have to face all sorts of things they had hoped were gone forever — constantly having to answer for his tweets, worrying about being the target of his tweets and a return to the chaos parade that characterized his administration.",
            "But there’s another possible twist that, so far at least, most Republicans in the Senate don’t even want to think about: Trump running and then getting indicted for his Jan. 6 conduct. That would give the nation a modern political first — a major party candidate with a realistic chance of winning the nomination while facing a felony criminal charge.",
            "Republican senators say that so far, they have not given the idea much thought — at least not that they’re willing to admit — and declined to say if an indictment for breaking the law would be disqualifying for a person vying to be constitutionally charged with carrying out the nation’s laws.",
            "“You’re talking about supposition. Wait till things happen and then we’ll talk, OK?” Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama told HuffPost this week.",
            "“Wow, I don’t know. I don’t know what the rules are,” said Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio. “I just haven’t thought about it.”",
            "The possibility is not as far-fetched as it might sound. Trump has seemingly all but announced plans to run again, hinting broadly his supporters will be happy with his decision.",
            "At the same time, signs have emerged that the Department of Justice is further along than had been thought with its investigation of the Jan. 6 attempted insurrection and what role Trump played in it. On July 26, Washington Post reported that Trump was being investigated for possible crimes related to Jan. 6, and CNN reported recently that Trump’s lawyers were in contact with the Justice Department about the probe and had warned Trump he could be charged.",
            "“Trump’s legal defense team has warned him that indictments are possible,” CNN said, citing unspecified sources.",
            "As for Portman’s question whether catching an indictment would be against the rules, there is nothing in the Republican Party’s official rules that mentions indictments or charges, nor in the last party platform adopted in 2016.",
            "That’s different from even the House Republicans’ rules, which explicitly say members of the party have to resign from their committee seats if indicted. In other words, an indictment could force a rank-and-file House Republican to resign from the third-tier House Budget Committee but have no formal impact on who can run for the party’s presidential nomination.",
            "Of GOP senators who had an opinion on what should happen if Trump runs as an indicted candidate, the feelings ranged the full spectrum.",
            "Sen. Rick Scott (Fla.), who heads the National Republican Senatorial Campaign charged with winning back the chamber for the GOP, said the call whether to run was Trump’s.",
            "“This is a choice that President Trump gets to make and that the voters get to decide,” he told HuffPost.",
            "Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.), a 2016 candidate for president, said an indictment would just be akin to criminalizing political differences.",
            "“I think prosecuting someone for their political beliefs or stances is not appropriate in a democracy,” he said. “Whether or not you think the governor should approve the electors or the Secretary of State or the state legislature sounds like a political point of view.”",
            "Sen. Lisa Murkowski, the Alaska Republican in a battle for reelection against a Trump-endorsed opponent, said talk of an indicted Trump running was “talking about scenarios way far down the road.”",
            "But asked if she thought an indictment would be disqualifying, Murkowski said, “Sure.”",
            "Florida’s Marco Rubio, another GOP presidential candidate Trump defeated in 2016, declined to comment, saying “I’m not doing any of that speculative stuff.”",
            "GOP leaders were also quiet on the question. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (Ky.) office declined to comment, though McConnell has hinted in the past Trump may be a nonissue for the GOP because it will have a “crowded field” of potential 2024 nominees.",
            "A request for comment with House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy’s office was not returned.",
            "One former Democratic presidential candidate did have an opinion, though. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), one of the last of the 2020 Democratic candidates to fall before President Joe Biden won the party’s nomination, said it shouldn’t take a formal charge to bar Trump.",
            "“Trump should be disqualified by the American voters who, by this point, should be appalled by all that has come out,” she said.",
            "“If the Republicans want to embrace a person under indictment for treasonous acts against the United States of America, then no one can stop them,” Warren added.",
            "“The Republicans have gone so far out that the American people — and that includes Democrats, Republicans and independents — have said, ‘No, we’re not going there with you.’”"

            "Surveillance footage captured the black Mercedes speeding past a red light on La Brea and Slauson avenues and hitting a light pole at 1:40 p.m. The vehicle reportedly crashed into at least six other cars — three of which went up in flames, the California Highway Patrol told CBS LA.",

            "The scientific community has come a long way when it comes to fertility treatments. Year after year, countless families turn to specialists and assisted reproductive technology to have children, and people are much more increasingly open to discussing their experiences with the process.",
            "But despite how advanced and normalized these options have become, there remains a serious barrier to entry: the cost.",
            "“Fertility treatment can be terrifyingly expensive,” Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst with LendingTree, told HuffPost. He cited a 2020 report from The Center for Reproductive Rights that found the median cost of a single IVF cycle in the United States is $19,200.",
            "“That’s a staggeringly high total, especially when you consider that many women require multiple cycles to become pregnant and that there is no guarantee of success no matter how many cycles you go through,” Schulz added. “Given those costs, it is no wonder that many people say they just can’t afford to do fertility treatments. It’s really nothing short of heartbreaking.”",
            "Of course, the range of costs can vary based on where you live and your individual needs when it comes to bloodwork, injections, egg retrieval, continued monitoring and more. But each step adds up, and it’s not uncommon for patients to accumulate thousands ― if not tens of thousands ― of dollars in debt to cover the out-of-pocket costs.",
            "Still, is it possible to pursue fertility treatment without incurring serious financial setbacks? Below, Schulz and other experts share their advice for avoiding or minimizing the burden.",
            "Map out your budget.",
            "The first step to managing any financial decision is determining your budget. Calculate your income and expenses each month to figure out what you’re currently able to spend and any changes you might make to accommodate fertility treatment payments.",
            "“It may sound simple, but a budget is where you have to start,” Schulz said. “You can’t make a meaningful plan to attack debt unless you know exactly how much money is coming in and going out of your household each month. Once you know that, you can start to prioritize where your money goes, whether that is saving for a potential treatment, carving out more money to pay down debt or any other reason.”",
            "Check your benefits.",
            "“It sucks that it has to be this way, but the truth is that it is pretty much up to the people seeking treatment to turn over every stone and exhaust every option in looking for safe, reliable and less expensive treatment,” Schulz said. “Check to see if your employer’s benefits cover these treatments. It’s more common than you might guess. Look into your insurance coverage.”",
            "While full IVF coverage might be hard to find, some insurance carriers cover other parts of the fertility treatment process ― like diagnostic testing and other assessments. There’s also been recent progress on the side of employer-provided benefits.",
            "“According to Fertility IQ, there is a 8% year-over-year increase in large employers providing additional coverage for family planning including IVF treatments, egg freezing and adoption,” said Nicole Carson, a financial planner with Brunch & Budget. “This is becoming increasingly popular in employee benefits packages as employers are looking to attract and retain top diverse talent.”",
            "She believes more employers will add family planning benefits to their packages as the job market remains competitive.",
            "Look for government programs.",
            "“There are some ways to save money on IVF treatments,” Carson said. “Because pricing depends on the state you live in, some states like New York, California and Texas offer government programs to subsidize the costs of IVF treatments. There are also income-based grants and scholarships at the national level.”",
            "Indeed, a number of organizations have programs to help families pay the out-of-pocket expenses of fertility treatments. Some are geared toward specific types of patients, like veterans, cancer survivors or Jewish families.",
            "Find the right doctor.",
            "After you get a sense of your coverage, find the right doctor for you. Your employee benefits might only apply to a specific provider, or you might have options.",
            "Some clinics also offer discounts for multiple rounds of treatment, so it’s best to familiarize yourself with all possibilities. Once you know where you’ll be receiving treatment, then you can make more meaningful calculations to determine the total cost of the endeavor.",
            "“Shop around to different clinics,” Schulz advised. “Research different loan options. You can even consider leaving the country to receive treatment, though that’s something that would require significant research and should not be entered into lightly.”",
            "Traveling out of the country would also mean additional costs to take into consideration.",
            "Ask yourself tough questions.",
            "“How we spend is a direct reflection of our priorities,” Schulz said. “For some, the idea of spending $20,000 for a treatment that might not even work doesn’t make sense. Others wouldn’t even hesitate to spend that much or more for as long as it takes. Whether you agree with the former, the latter or something in between, make sure that you do your due diligence and ask yourself some tough questions before you make the call.”",
            "For many families, the stakes involved in the choice to pursue expensive fertility treatment are too high to justify it.",
            "“Unfortunately, you may have to ultimately decide that it just isn’t financially feasible,” Schulz said. “Our absurdly high-priced health care in this country forces people to make heartbreaking decisions about their health and their family’s wellbeing every single day. That’s true whether you’re talking about cancer medications, fertility treatments or countless other things facing Americans today. It’s an absolute tragedy, but it is where we are right now.”",
            "Set aside whatever money you can.",
            "“If you want to avoid debt to pay for fertility treatment, set a goal to set money aside over the next X months,” recommended finance coach Tatiana Tsoir. “Maybe skip a latte, or the next phone upgrade, or a vacation next time. All of those things add up really quickly and can break the bank.”",
            "Even if you can’t fully avoid incurring debt, starting a fund can reduce the amount you’ll end up having to take out in loans. Think about it sooner rather than later, Tsoir advised.",
            "“I say ‘start saving now,’” she urged. “It’s a good idea to save ‘just because’ for all adults, and a rainy day fund can come in handy in a situation when you want to start a family.”",
            "You might also consider looking into passive savings options. Personal finance platforms like Mint and Digit offer many different routes to explore ― like investing in index funds.",
            "Prepare for the hidden costs.",
            "“Fertility has a lot of hidden costs, including mental health and physical health,” Tsoir said. “The drugs you take affect your skin and your overall health and can affect your self esteem and, in turn, affect your mental health.”",
            "Think about the time you might need to take off work to deal with potential issues. She recommended reading other people’s accounts of the fertility treatment experience to give yourself a sense of things that could happen.",

            "“It is critical to understand what you’re getting into before you apply for any of these loans,” Schulz emphasized. “Fertility treatments are so expensive, so making a rushed or ill-informed choice on how to finance them can end up being very costly.”",
            "He suggested looking into credit cards with a 0% introductory interest rate, but ensuring you know what the post-introductory interest rate is in case you can’t pay off the entire amount in that initial period. A personal loan is another option to help you manage your out-of-pocket costs.",
            "“You won’t find 0% offers with these loans, but if you have good credit, they can often come with lower interest rates than you’d find with credit cards,” Schulz explained. “There are also IVF loans available from fertility clinics specifically for the needs of folks receiving these treatments.”",
            "Carson noted that the more favorable your credit score is, the less interest you’ll have to pay.",
            "“Consider a fixed-rate loan over a credit card where your payments are variable,” she said. This will help to keep your payments consistent and often offer a lower rate to borrow. And consider the length of time it will take you to pay the debt back ― choose a length of time that is going to fit within your budget.”"

            "The Department of Justice on Thursday charged four current and former Louisville Metro Police Department officers with federal crimes related to the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor in March 2020.",
            "Former Officers Joshua Jaynes, Brett Hankison, and Kelly Goodlett were arrested Thursday by the FBI. Sgt. Kyle Meany, who still works for the department, also was arrested.",
            "The charges allege Jaynes, Hankison and Goodlett used false and misleading information to obtain the search warrant that sent officers to Taylor’s home, where they used a battering ram to break through the door and “blindly” fire bullets inside that killed the 26-year-old hospital technician.",
            "Jaynes wrote in the 2020 warrant application that he’d “verified with a U.S. Postal Inspector” that Taylor’s ex-boyfriend, a suspected drug dealer, had been using her address to receive packages.",
            "That wasn’t true, according to the Justice Department.",
            "“The federal charges announced today allege that members of a Police Investigations Unit falsified the affidavit used to obtain the search warrant of Ms. Taylor’s home and that this act violated federal civil rights laws, and that those violations resulted in Ms. Taylor’s death,“ Attorney General Merrick Garland said at a news conference Thursday.",
            "The Justice Department also slapped Jaynes and Goodlett with conspiracy charges, alleging they met in a garage in May 2020, “where they agreed to tell investigators a false story.” Goodlett was charged in a criminal information, not a grand jury indictment, a step that often indicates a plea agreement.",
            "In a second indictment, prosecutors say Hankison used unconstitutionally excessive force during the raid when he moved from Taylor’s doorway to the side of the building, where he fired 10 shots into her apartment through a bedroom window and a sliding glass door, both of which were covered with blinds and curtains.",
            "“Today’s indictment alleges that Hankison’s use of excessive force violated the rights of Breonna Taylor and her guest, and also of her neighbors, whose lives were endangered by bullets that penetrated into their apartment,” Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said.",
            "Louisville police fired Hankison for his actions. He was also charged with three counts of wanton endangerment, but a Kentucky jury acquitted him.",
            "Ben Crump, a lawyer representing Taylor’s family, welcomed the federal charges.",
            "“We hope this announcement of a guilty plea sends a message to all other involved officers that it is time to stop covering up and time to accept responsibility for their roles in causing the death of an innocent, beautiful young Black woman,” Crump said in a statement.",
            "“There are still so many families who are fighting and praying for justice and accountability in situations where their loved ones were wrongfully killed by the police,” he continued. “We need to stand with them, fight with them, pray with them, and do whatever is possible for them.”"

            "In this edition of Voices In Food, Stacey Truman, a cafeteria manager at Kingston Elementary School in Virginia Beach, Virginia, shares what’s kept her in the school kitchen for 18 years and what she wants everyone to know about her job.",
            "As an elementary school cafeteria manager, I’m often the first one in the building. I wake up at 4 a.m., take a shower, get myself ready and am on the road by 4:30 to be at the school by 5 a.m. Often, I’m the last person to leave, too. Cafeteria workers do a lot more than people realize.",
            "Before we start thinking about making lunch for the kids, we have to get breakfast ready to go. There are about 50 kids at our school that receive free breakfast, double what it was before the pandemic. As soon as breakfast is over, it’s time to start making lunch. If we’re serving chicken nuggets, pizza or brunch-for-lunch, we know it’s going to be busy — those are definitely the most popular meals with the kids.",
            "I’ve been a cafeteria worker at the school for 18 years. When I first started, I was 21 years old and saw it as a job that I would be able to move up in. Then, I ended up having my first child, so becoming a manager took a back seat. But I eventually did get promoted to manager when I was pregnant with my second child.",
            "What I love most about my job is the kids. I treat them as if they were my own, whether it’s by offering encouragement, disciplining when needed, and, of course, feeding them. At this point, I’ve watched so many of them grow up. I’ve seen the kindergarteners turn into first graders, second graders and then eventually leave the school after fifth grade. I’ve even seen some of them graduate from high school. They’ll come back at the end of their senior year to do a walk-through and stop by to see me.",
            "On sending sweet notes to kids",
            "I started writing messages on bananas in 2018. At first, I only did it for my girls when I was packing their lunches in the morning. Since my hours are so long, I’d leave before they woke up and there was a period of time when I was working a second job, so I didn’t get home until after they were asleep. When I made their lunches, I would write encouraging messages on their bananas, oranges, fruit cups, or whatever I was packing for them that day. One day, my mom saw me writing them and said, “You should do that for the kids at your school.”",
            "When she said that, I laughed. “Do you know how much time that would take?” I told her. But then one day, we had a box of bananas at the school and I had some free time, so I decided to do it. I wrote things like, “Never give up,” “Your future is bright,” and “Inspire yourself and others” — the same messages I would write for my own girls.",
            "Four years later, I’m still writing on fruit for the kids. I also paint art to hang in the school cafeteria featuring characters they like; I’m working on a Buzz Lightyear one right now. In May, I did a “Star Wars” theme that the kids especially liked. I always make the characters have chat bubbles giving a positive message or moral lesson, such as, “Be good to each other.” I switch out the paintings every month with new ones and also hang decorations for holidays, like Valentine’s Day or Saint Patrick’s Day. I pay for it out of my own pocket and don’t get reimbursed. I do it simply because I love the kids.",
            "How work changed during COVID",
            "When COVID hit, we shifted the way we worked. It was still important to make sure the kids were fed lunch (and breakfast, for those who relied on that). For some kids, the meals they get at school are their only meals of the day due to economic restraints. We pivoted our operations and did packed breakfasts, lunches and dinners for the kids. The parents or child could just come straight to the school and pick them up.",
            "Eventually, the school offered the choice of in-person learning or remote learning. When that happened, we worked double duty, preparing both the meals to be served at the school and also the packed meals. It was overwhelming.",
            "The best part of the job",
            "Really what being a cafeteria worker is all about is the kids. I hope they learn from me, but I learn from them, too. The biggest lesson they’ve taught me is how to love. When I see how kind they are to each other, it inspires me. Especially thinking of how much kids have been through these past few years, I’ve learned that kids really are resilient.",
            "Cafeteria workers often go unnoticed. It can be a thankless job, but it’s so important. You never know what a child is going through at home. You might be the only person showing them kindness or feeding them that day. Even if you aren’t, the simple act of feeding a child one, two or even three meals a day is important. My whole team and I give 110% of ourselves to our job and it certainly isn’t because of the money or the hours. It’s about the kids."

            "Throughout the week, unconfirmed reports and speculation about potentially drastic cuts at HBO Max have left viewers and subscribers panicking about the future of the streaming platform, its celebrated original shows and its plentiful back catalog.",
            "Then came the news Tuesday that executives have axed the “Batgirl” movie ― recently filmed for a planned HBO Max-only release ― with no plans to make it available for viewing anywhere. HBO Max subscribers have also noticed some of the platform’s original movies disappearing in recent days.",
            "All of it is a result of HBO Max’s parent company, WarnerMedia, recently completing its merger with Discovery. The company has cut programming on several of its brands, including CNN+ abruptly shutting down just weeks after launching; TBS scaling back much of its comedy programming; and HBO Max deprioritizing its kids’ and family shows, like canceling “Gordita Chronicles.”",
            "However, various announcements Thursday suggested the future of HBO Max, which may be the best overall streaming platform in terms of the quality of its original shows, may not be as dire as feared ― at least for now.",
            "On a company earnings call Thursday, executives announced plans to combine HBO Max with Discovery’s streaming service Discovery+, with the goal of launching the new service in the U.S. in summer 2023.",
            "Earlier in the day, the company announced that select shows from Chip and Joanna Gaines’ Magnolia Network, which is part of Discovery, will become available on HBO Max starting Sept. 30. The platform will feature a special page of Magnolia Network content, including all five seasons of “Fixer Upper,” “Fixer Upper: Welcome Home,” “Magnolia Table with Joanna Gaines” and “Family Dinner with Andrew Zimmern.” The shows will also still be available on Discovery+.",
            "In a similar move, several CNN shows will also be available on Discovery+ beginning Aug. 19, including “Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,” “Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy,” W. Kamau Bell’s “United Shades of America” and Lisa Ling’s “This Is Life.” More CNN shows will gradually be added to Discovery+ in a special hub page, after they air on CNN.",
            "On the earnings call, JB Perrette, the company’s head of global streaming, said this “content-sharing” will continue to be part of the company’s streaming strategy before the new combined service is ready for launch.",
            "He also said the company is exploring different subscription and pricing levels, including a free, ad-supported level, with more details to be announced later this year.",
            "When asked by an investor about the rumors of “gutting” HBO Max, CEO David Zaslav rejected the notion and said the company would continue to spend on HBO Max, calling it “an extraordinary asset.”"

            "“Well, you know, we aren’t friends as much as we used to be because I honestly think because we publicly disagreed on his running for office, his supporting Trump, I think it became too much for us to sustain our friendship, honestly,” Legend said.",
            "Back in April 2018, the two had a text battle over West’s support of Trump, with Legend telling the rapper:",
            "“So many people who love you feel so betrayed right now because they know the harm that Trump’s policies cause, especially to people of color. Don’t let this be part of your legacy.”",

            "“I wasn’t alone in that, but, you know, he was not happy about that. And we really haven’t been close since then,” Legend said.",

            "“I think he’s been very open with who he is and his struggles with mental health. And he’s very real, honestly. So I think there’s not a lot about him that people don’t get,” he said. “Like he’s been pretty upfront with his opinions, his struggles, all the things that he’s dealing with. And I think what you see with him is pretty much what you get.”",

            "“Holy Fvck” is the name of Demi Lovato’s upcoming album ― and presumably the reaction Wilmer Valderrama had when listening to her pointed new track.",
            "A snippet of a currently unreleased song titled “29” from Lovato’s eighth studio album made the internet rounds this week, leading many fans to believe that it references the former couple’s 12-year age difference.",
            "Lovato, 29, and Valderrama, 42, dated for nearly six years before calling it quits in 2016 and seemingly have remained on good terms since then.",
            "But the new song, which the singer has yet to confirm or deny is about the “That ’70s Show” alum, paints a decidedly different picture and contains lyrics about a troubling relationship with a much older boyfriend seemingly aimed at Valderrama.",
            "“Petal on the vine / Too young to drink wine / Just five years of bleeders, student and a teacher,” she sings on the track, which was posted on TikTok by Demi_Artistry. “Far from innocent / What the fuck’s consent? / Numbers told you not to / But that didn’t stop you.”",
            "“Finally 29 / Funny, just like you were at the time / Thought it was a teenage dream, just a fantasy / But was it yours or was it mine? / 17, 29.”",
            "Lovato, who recently announced is once again using she/her pronouns, previously shared how the two first crossed paths while filming a PSA together back in 2010, when she was 17 and ― yes, you guessed it ― he was right around 29 years old.",
            "“Of course, I was like, ‘Oh my god. You’re so attractive,’” she told Complex in a 2015 profile. “And he was like, ‘You are not 18. Get away from me.’ Then we became really good friends, and he was there for me through a number of situations and breakups and whatever. Then as I got older and we grew closer, it was like, ‘Hey, maybe we should try this thing out.’ We did, and we’ve basically been together ever since.”",
            "In her candid YouTube documentary “Simply Complicated” released in 2017, Lovato expanded upon the story, insisting once again that they didn’t begin dating until she was of legal age.“[When] I met him and I laid eyes on him for the first time, I was in hair and makeup, and he came in and sat down, and I was like ‘I love this man,’ and ‘I have to have him.’”“After I turned 18, we began dating,” she continued. “I think it was love at first sight, and I don’t really believe in that, but I believe that it happened.”",
            "During their relationship, Lovato heaped praises upon Valderrama for his support for helping her stay sober amid her addiction battle.",
            "“He’ll never take credit for a lot of my sobriety and my recovery, but I guarantee it, I wouldn’t be alive without him today,” she told HuffPost Live in 2015.",
            "The two ultimately went their separate ways a year later, explaining in a joint statement on Instagram at the time that they just work “better as friends.”",
            "“After almost 6 loving and wonderful years together, we have decided to end our relationship,” the statement read. “This was an incredibly difficult decision for both of us, but we have realized more than anything that we are better as best friends. We will always be supportive of one another.”Both have moved onto new relationships since then and even reunited professionally for the animated movie “Charming,” which was released on Netflix last year.Lovato congratulated Valderrama on his engagement to model Amanda Pacheco, sharing that she’s “really happy for him,” and she wishes him “nothing but the best.”",
            "“We’re not in each other’s lives, haven’t spoken in a long time. But I think I needed that because I needed to learn to be OK on my own,” she told Harper’s Bazaar in 2020. “When you get into a relationship with somebody at that young of an age and then you spend six years with somebody, you don’t really get to learn about yourself.”"

            "A sinkhole initially measured at 82 feet wide and 650 feet deep opened outside the Chilean town of Tierra Amarilla on land owned by Canada’s Lundin Mining company over the weekend, according to Vice.",
            "The National Service of Geology and Mining (Sernageomin) announced on Twitter that it first noticed the depression on Saturday. The sinkhole appeared near the Alcaparrosa copper mine in a relatively unpopulated part of the Atacama region 400 miles north of the Santiago capital.",
            "On Tuesday, Sernageomin stated that the sinkhole was wider than first thought, measuring at roughly 105 feet across.",
            "“There is a considerable distance ... to the bottom,” Sernageomin director David Montenegro said in a statement. “We haven’t detected any material down there, but we have seen the presence of a lot of water.”",
            "Lundin Mining said in a statement Monday that “upon detection, the area was immediately isolated and the relevant regulatory authorities notified. There has been no impact to personnel, equipment, or infrastructure,” and added that the sinkhole has since remained stable.",
            "Despite the lack of injuries or fatalities, however, Tierra Amarilla Mayor Cristóbal Zúñiga told Ciudadano ADN Radio the town experiences daily tremors emanating from the mining site that “have destroyed our houses and our streets, and today, destroyed the ground.”",
            "“Today it happened in a space that’s an agricultural property, but our greatest fear now is that this could happen in a populated place, on a street, in a school,” Zuñiga told Ciudadano ADN, according to a Vice translation. “Protecting the integrity of our inhabitants is our greatest concern at the moment.”",
            "The 25-year-old mayor reminded listeners that Lundin Mining came under fire from the government before. In July 2021, Chile’s environmental regulator filed charges against the company for violating agreements by breaching its operational permits at a different mine, according to Reuters.",
            "“The government, Sernageomin, and this company must be held responsible and be investigated quickly regarding what happened and why,” Zuñiga told Ciudadano ADN. “Sernageomin must get its act together and do a good job and clarify what the reason is, and if it is connected to mining activity, or due to nature.”",
            "Lundin Mining mainly targets copper, gold, nickel and zinc and also operates in Brazil, Argentina, Sweden, Portugal and the United States, according to its website. The company’s statement said it “temporarily suspended” work in Tierra Amarilla “as a preventative measure.”",
            "Zúñiga, who told Ciudadano ADN that his community “has always had a fear that something like this could happen,” said these assurances aren’t enough. Latin America has seen an enormous increase in foreign mining companies following the North American Free Trade Act of 1994, according to Vice. Canada alone has since signed agreements with Chile, Peru, Panama, Colombia and Honduras that permit it to extract natural resources."

            "Brad Pitt, defender of men in skirts and now Ana de Armas, would like us all to calm down about her portrayal of Marilyn Monroe in “Blonde.”",
            "Critiques zero in on the Cuban-born actor’s accent in the recently dropped trailer for director Andrew Dominik’s upcoming Netflix biopic about the Hollywood icon. Pitt, who co-produced the movie, weighed in on the conversation during a recent stop of his linen-forward press tour for his action comedy film “Bullet Train.”",
            "“She is phenomenal in it,” Pitt told Entertainment Tonight about de Armas on Tuesday. “That’s a tough dress to fill.”",
            "The Oscar winner went on to impress just how key de Armas was to making the film work, given how other actors, including Jessica Chastain and Naomi Watts, were all previously attached to star as Monroe in the film.",
            "“It was 10 years in the making,” Pitt said of the project, which was based on the novel by Joyce Carol Oates of the same name. “It wasn’t until we found Ana that we could get it across the finish line.”",
            "The film, which has received a rare NC-17 rating, took an unflinching approach to exploring the psyche of the screen legend, weaving both fictional and historical strands into a story about trauma and exploitation.",
            "Many have been skeptical of de Armas’ casting from the onset, but the scrutiny only intensified after the official trailer revealed how the star recreated Monroe’s signature breathy tone. Some fans were up in arms over de Armas’ accent appearing to break through in certain moments.",
            "On the heels of the trailer’s release, Monroe’s estate, which is owned by a conglomerate of brands, came to her defense amid the controversy.",
            "“Any actor that steps into that role knows they have big shoes to fill,” Marc Rosen, president of entertainment at Authentic Brands Group (ABG), told Variety in a statement. “Based on the trailer alone, it looks like Ana was a great casting choice as she captures Marilyn’s glamour, humanity and vulnerability. We can’t wait to see the film in its entirety!”",
            "The 34-year-old has previously spoken about the lengths she went to prepare for the role, including how she worked extensively to perfect the character’s voice before even stepping onto the set.",
            "“It took me nine months of dialect coaching, and practicing and some ADR sessions,” de Armas told The UK Times. “It was a big torture, so exhausting. My brain was fried.”",
            "Viewers will have their chance to judge de Armas’ performance when “Blonde” arrives in the fall, but at least she also has “Knives Out” co-star Jamie Lee Curtis in her corner. The actor, whose father, Tony Curtis, famously starred alongside the real Monroe in “Some Like It Hot,” heaped praises upon de Armas after seeing an early cut of the film.",
            "“I dropped to the floor,” Curtis told Vanity Fair. “I couldn’t believe it. Ana was completely gone. She was Marilyn.”",
            "See for yourself when “Blonde” hits Netflix on Sept. 28."

            "Candace Cameron Bure went full-on ’Merica during a July 4 TikTok last month. In the video, Bure sports an ensemble brimming with nods to the American flag, complete with a headband topped with stars.",
            "As she shows off her over-the-top outfit, she laughs and says, “I mean, c’mon, did you expect anything less from me? Happy Fourth of July!”",
            "Well, it seems not everyone was a fan of Bure’s post — but not because she looked like a cartoonish embodiment of the Pledge of Allegiance.",
            "Musician Mathew Koma, who is married to actor Hilary Duff, took issue with Bure’s choice of background music.",
            "Presumably Bure thought the song she chose to play — Bruce Springsteen’s 1986 hit “Born in the U.S.A.” — was an uncomplicated celebration of patriotism and would lend itself to the campiness of her post.",
            "But Koma pointed out in his own TikTok that the upbeat tune has a darker meaning than most suspect.",
            "“Yeah, that song you’re playing,” he says in a side-by-side duet post that features Bure’s July 4 video. “It’s about veterans coming home from Vietnam and being treated like shit. It’s not about the Fourth of July.”",
            "In his 2016 memoir “Born to Run,” Springsteen called “Born in the U.S.A.” a “protest song.” He was inspired to write it after going to a 1981 benefit concert in Los Angeles for Vietnam veterans, per NPR. The lyrics of the verses describe a man who feels lost, enlists, and returns home to a nation that could care less about his service to the country. The song’s upbeat chorus is meaningful as well.",
            "“The pride was in the chorus,” Springsteen said to host Terry Gross in a 2005 interview. “In my songs, the spiritual part, the hope part, is in the choruses. The blues and your daily realities are in the details of the verses.”",
            "Bure has not responded to being called out for her foible — but if she does, here’s hoping she doesn’t just respond with a “Full House” GIF with one of the show’s catchphrases."

            "The parent of a child killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting testified Tuesday that conspiracist Alex Jones must be held accountable for the lies he spread about his dead child over the years.",
            "“Alex Jones’ apologies are worthless,” Neil Heslin, whose 6-year-old boy Jesse Lewis died in the 2012 shooting, testified. “At this stage, any apology would not be sincere, it’s gone too late. I don’t even know if Alex is capable of a sincere apology.”",
            "Jones is on trial in Austin, Texas, where his conspiracy outlet Infowars is based, to determine how much money he will ultimately have to pay to parents Heslin and Scarlett Lewis, whose son was killed in the shooting that left 20 kids and six adults dead. For years, Jones and others connected to him have peddled that lie that the shooting was fake.",
            "Heslin made clear in court Tuesday that he isn’t after Jones’ money, but that hitting him in his wallet may be the only way to get him to stop his lies.",
            "“I believe it’s the only way to put a stop to it, to prevent this from happening anymore,” Heslin said. “There’s got to be a strong deterrent to put a stop to what is being said.”",
            "Heslin described his son as an “energetic” child who loved animals and helping others. The day of the shooting, Jesse led his classmates to safety and likely saved lives. Jones was not in court during Heslin’s testimony.",
            "“It’s disrespectful,” Heslin told the jury of Jones’ absence in the court. “I think it’s a cowardly act of Alex Jones not to face me here in this courtroom. He doesn’t have the courage to sit here and face me.”",
            "While Heslin testified, Jones went on his Infowars program to accuse Heslin of being “slow” and “on the Spectrum.”",
            "Heslin described the harassment he has faced over years, including an incident he described as “a few years back” in which his house and vehicles were shot at.",
            "“I fear for my life, for my safety, for my family’s safety,” Heslin said. He and Lewis have had private security with them as the trial, now in its second week, plays out.",
            "In her own testimony Tuesday, Lewis described a Christmas morning after the shooting when a man drove up to the home to take pictures. Lewis said she now has a gun for protection from those who might seek to harm her remaining son.",
            "“I’m a single mother responsible for the safety of both my boys, and I was not able to keep one of them safe,” Lewis testified. “So I am going to keep my surviving son safe.”",
            "Later on Tuesday, Jones showed up to the courtroom and listened to Lewis’ testimony. Lewis took the opportunity to speak to Jones directly, shaming him several times for his constant lies.",
            "“I wanted to tell you to your face, because I wanted you to know I am a mother first and foremost, and I know you’re a father,” Lewis said to Jones. “My son existed, and you’re still on your show today trying to say I’m fine, I’m an actress, I’m deep state. Stop.”",
            "She asked if Jones had empathy and told him he has played a role in polarizing this country. When she spoke of Jesse, she told Jones to pay attention to her words.",
            "“It seems so incredible to me that we have to do this, that we have to implore you ― not just implore, punish you ― because you won’t stop lying, saying it’s a hoax,” Lewis said. “It happened. It’s surreal what’s going on in here.”",
            "A voicemail message was also played in court from Infowars listener Lucy Richards, who was sentenced to five months in prison for sending death threats to Sandy Hook parent Lenny Pozner.",
            "“You’re a loser, you’re going to rot in hell,” Richards said in the voicemail played for the jury. “Death is coming to you real soon, motherfucker. You are going to die.”",
            "Jones’ attorney, Andino Reynal, said in his questioning of Heslin that the Sandy Hook lie did not originate with Jones. Heslin said that even if it were true, it was Jones’ massive platform that allowed the lies to proliferate.",
            "“Alex is the one who lit the match and started the fire,” Heslin told the court. “Others were bringing him wood to keep it going. That’s because Alex has such a large platform.”",
            "Lawyers for the plaintiffs are seeking $150 million in damages.",

            "Bandit, a 20-pound (9.1-kilogram) cat, lives with her retired owner Fred Everitt in the Tupelo suburb of Belden. When at least two people tried to break into their shared home last week, the cat did everything she could to alert Everitt of the danger, he told the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal.",
            "“You hear of guard dogs,” said Everitt, 68. “This is a guard cat.”",
            "The attempted robbery occurred sometime between 2:30 and 3 a.m. on July 25, Everitt said. He was first awoken by Bandit’s meows in the kitchen. Then, she raced into the bedroom, jumped onto the bed and began pulling the comforter off of him and clawing at his arms. Everitt knew something was wrong.",
            "“She had never done that before,” Everitt said. “I went, ‘What in the world is wrong with you?’”",
            "Everitt got up to investigate and saw two young men outside his back door. One had a handgun, and the other was using a crowbar to try and pry the door open, he said.",
            "Everitt said by the time he retrieved a handgun and returned to the kitchen, the would-be intruders had already fled. Everitt told the newspaper that he did not call the police.",

            "The Senate on Tuesday passed a bill to expand health care and disability benefits to millions of veterans — less than a week after more than two dozen Republicans blocked it and drew outrage from the veterans’ community, comedian Jon Stewart and others.",
            "The Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act, or the PACT Act, passed in a 86-11 vote. It now heads to President Joe Biden’s desk to be signed into law.",
            "It should have passed the Senate last week. A similar version of the PACT Act passed the Senate in June, in an 84-14 vote. It’s not particularly controversial: It would allow soldiers, sailors and airmen exposed to pits of burnt waste in combat zones to be covered by the Veterans Affairs health care system for related illnesses. Many of these vets got sick from exposure to burn pits during the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars.",
            "But last Wednesday, right after the news broke that Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) had struck a deal on a massive tax and climate change package, 25 Republicans unexpectedly blocked the PACT Act despite previously voting to advance it. It made no sense, except in the context of Republicans having a full-blown tantrum about a Democratic deal they didn’t like and taking out their anger on a totally unrelated veterans bill.",
            "Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) led the GOP effort to block the bill, saying he wanted to add an amendment related to budgetary spending.",
            "The GOP vote to block the bill spurred veterans to show up outside the Capitol in protest, some of whom had been camped outside of the building for days. Stewart, who has advocated on behalf of veterans for years, joined them and tore into Republicans as “stab-vets-in-the-back senators.”",
            "“If this is America first, then America is fucked,” Stewart fumed.",
            "But on Tuesday, Republicans folded and agreed to move forward on the bill on the condition that they could get votes on three GOP amendments. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) wanted to reduce aid to other countries to help pay for the PACT Act. Toomey wanted to classify funding for the PACT Act as discretionary versus mandatory. Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) wanted to shift veterans care into private community care.",

            "Just before the bill passed, Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), the bill’s sponsor, tweeted a video of Stewart hugging him and thanking him outside the Capitol for getting the bill done.",
            "“My man, pots and pans!” Stewart shouted at Tester.",

Prior to that, police say Sigman got into a verbal altercation with another man at a popular pizzeria called Leopoldo’s. The man told security guards that Sigman threatened to shoot him. Security then approached Sigman, saw that he had a weapon and asked him to leave. Sigman left and headed toward a nearby parking deck, where he began shooting at a parked car and struck Jones, who was in a vehicle with two of her friends. Jones’ friends drove her to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead.",

            "A decade ago, Dan Giusti was the head chef at Noma, which repeatedly has been named the best restaurant in the world. These days, the average person he cooks for is around 4 feet tall and likely missing a few teeth.",
            "In 2016, Giusti left Noma and founded Brigaid, a program that places professional chefs in school kitchens to help cafeteria lunch staff cook up delicious, nourishing meals for kids — all within budget.",
            "Six years later, Brigaid is still going strong. In this edition of Voices In Food, Giusti shares in his own words what he loves about cooking for kids, what’s most challenging, and how he’s taking Brigaid’s mission to populations outside of school cafeterias.",
            "There’s a lot that’s different about cooking for a cafeteria full of elementary schoolers than a table of people who can afford to fly to Copenhagen and spend thousands on a meal, but one thing they have in common is that they’ll tell you what they think of the food. You don’t pay $250 for an entree to grin and bear it. And with kids, you always know exactly where they stand about something.",
            "The stereotype for what school lunches taste like... isn’t great. The same goes for hospitals, senior centers and prisons. In every single one of these institutions, food plays a hugely important role. Despite this, they aren’t places that traditionally attract top-tier chefs. That’s what I’m trying to change.",
            "I’m hoping that when chefs graduate culinary school, they get excited about using their creativity in kitchens that serve these populations. Right now, in addition to public schools across the country, Brigaid has started to work with senior centers in New York and we’re in the process of piloting a program that places a chef in a prison. But it all started with kids.",
            "When it comes to making school lunches, there are a lot of challenges, but the biggest ones are staying within budget (on average, $3.81 per meal), hitting the government nutritional guidelines and making foods kids actually want to eat. I’ll tell you this: Kids are a heck of a lot more likely to eat fruit when it’s sliced and seasoned than when it’s in the form of a waxy apple not even cut up. But these challenges are part of the fun of getting creative as a chef: “You have $3, a fridge full of fresh ingredients, and a building full of hungry kids. Go!”",
            "Creating lunches for kids, I’ve learned that they love pizza from scratch (not so surprising), but they also love broccoli, steamed and cooked in garlic oil. Other cooked vegetables aren’t a crowd-pleasure just yet, but kids crush garlic broccoli.",
            "Just like everyone else, we pivoted the way we worked during the height of the pandemic, but our chefs didn’t stop cooking; Kids still had to eat. We just worked differently, depending on the guidelines different school districts set in place.",
            "The first priority was safety. Unfortunately, many people working in school kitchens weren’t being provided with masks, so getting protective materials was the most pressing priority. Then the focus became: How do we keep these kids fed? In some places, parents could come to the school and pick up packed lunches. In other places, we delivered the lunches to the kids’ bus stops so the parents didn’t have to drive to the school.",
            "We were also realistic about the type of meals we could make. Before the pandemic, the emphasis was on making everything from scratch. But with other new constraints, we relaxed on that a little. The focus became more about logistics: What was less labor intensive? How could we keep the food hot? It’s a lesson that applies in the broader sense: When life gets hard, find ways to give yourself a break.",
            "Here’s something else I’ve learned: When it comes to changing the way massive institutions like public schools or prisons approach food, the ingredients aren’t what’s most important. Sure, it’s great to have fresh produce, but what matters most are the people. The thing is, cooking isn’t all that complicated. But without strong relationships, no lasting change is going to happen.",
            "I think sometimes in the food world, the importance of food can be placed over the importance of people. There are some chefs who are really ambitious and they want to focus on the quality of the food and how each carefully crafted entree comes out. That’s great and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that. But, ultimately, people are what’s most important — and that goes for any system, not just food.",
            "The pandemic has really shaken up the restaurant industry and it will be interesting to see what happens moving forward. I hope the chefs in culinary school right now start thinking about working at places like schools, senior centers and hospitals after they graduate. I think that would be really cool. And it will make you a better chef, too.",
            "Because, again, kids don’t hold anything back. If they don’t like your pasta with homemade Alfredo sauce, you’ll know it. There’s no doubt about that."

            "Just hours earlier, Bowers told the Jan. 6 panel of the intense pressure on him as Trump and lawyer Rudy Giuliani pressed to invalidate the state’s election results. Bowers said the pair never produced any substantial evidence to back up their election fraud claims.",

            "“If I pull this off, it’s going to be a miracle,” Bowers told NBC News last month.",
            "Trump has campaigned for Farnsworth, unusual in a state race, calling Bowers a “RINO,” or Republican in name only.",

            "A representative for Gigi said at the time that she was “solely focused on the best for Khai” and privacy, while Malik later addressed the charges in a message on social media.",
            "“As you all know I am a private person and I very much want to create a safe and private place for my daughter to grow up in,” the singer wrote in October 2021. “In an effort to protect that space for her, I agreed to not contest claims arising from an argument I had with a family member of my partner’s who entered our home while my partner was away several weeks ago.”",

            "A multi-candidate Democratic primary in Manhattan has tightened considerably in recent weeks due to gains made by challenger Suraj Patel, according to a poll commissioned by Patel’s campaign in late July.",
            "The survey of Democratic primary voters in New York’s 12th Congressional District found that after providing respondents a one-paragraph description of the three top candidates, Reps. Carolyn Maloney and Jerry Nadler each enjoy 31% support ahead of Patel with 25% support.",
            "Patel, an attorney and business ethics lecturer, is highlighting his improved standing since early June when an internal poll showed him with 19% support after providing respondents a brief description of Patel.",
            "“We’ve tapped into both a moment and an argument for change here against two incumbents who are running campaigns that are very, very much backwards-looking at a time when people are looking for hope and light at the end of the tunnel,” Patel told HuffPost.",
            "Patel’s advance in his internal polling follows a month of television advertising. He beat Maloney and Nadler to the airwaves with his first ad in late June.",
            "The campaign’s poll, conducted by Whitman Insight Strategies, used live phone and text-to-web questions among 300 likely Democratic primary voters. The margin of error was plus or minus 5.65 percentage points.",
            "There is a major caveat when assessing the significance of Patel’s July poll, however.",
            "In June, Whitman Insight Strategies tested Patel’s support without describing his candidacy, as well as after describing his candidacy. Without a description of his candidacy, Patel registered just 11% support in June.",
            "For the late July survey, the pollster decided to ask respondents about how they planned to vote only after describing Patel’s candidacy. That decision suggests the campaign wanted to highlight only the number that would make Patel look more competitive.",
            "Primaries are often difficult to accurately poll. A race in late August decoupled from statewide intra-party contests could be especially tough to survey. (A federal judge required New York to postpone congressional primaries for about two months so candidates would have enough time to campaign in the new districts.)",
            "In New York’s 12th, polling has been accordingly sparse. Maloney led Nadler by 10 points and Patel had just 4% support in a May survey conducted by Emerson College for PIX11.",
            "The primary in New York’s 12th has been dominated by very public sniping between Nadler and Maloney, both of whom are approaching 30 years in Congress. Nadler has argued that he is more progressive than Maloney, noting his support for the Iran nuclear agreement and opposition to the Iraq War.",
            "Maloney has drawn on her career as a trailblazing female elected official to argue that she is best-equipped to confront the country’s challenges following the Supreme Court decision overturning a federal right to abortion. She concludes her first TV ad with the words, “You cannot send a man to do a woman’s job.”",
            "Patel, an East Village resident who identifies as a “pragmatic progressive,” has proposed a suite of policies designed to combat inflation that he calls ”the abundant society.” He also espouses a non-interventionist foreign policy that is closer to Nadler’s than Maloney’s in orientation, and has attacked Maloney for previously amplifying skepticism of childhood vaccination regimens.",
            "Patel’s main focus, however, has been in appealing to voters interested in a new generation of leadership, especially people living in parts of Manhattan that neither Maloney nor Nadler currently represent.",
            "The election will be a “referendum on their effectiveness contrasted with a message for the future,” Patel predicted.",
            "This is Patel’s third consecutive campaign to unseat Maloney, who lives on Manhattan’s Upper East Side.",
            "The contest fundamentally changed in April, however, when New York’s top court struck down New York Democrats’ redistricting lines and ordered the drawing of nonpartisan congressional and state Senate boundaries. The new, court-ordered maps that emerged in May placed Patel, Maloney and Nadler, a resident of Manhattan’s Upper West Side, in the same district.",
            "Rana Abdelhamid, a left-wing Google employee from Astoria, Queens, subsequently withdrew from the race, leaving the newcomer lane to Patel and Ashmi Sheth, a former bank regulator at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
            "Maloney, Nadler and Patel are due to compete in a televised debate at 7 p.m. Tuesday on NY1.",
            "Early voting begins in New York’s congressional primary elections on Aug. 13. Election Day is Aug. 23.",
            "This story has been updated to include additional information about how the July poll was conducted."

            "Smith released a nearly six-minute video Friday in which he said he was “deeply remorseful” for his actions and that he’d “been doing a lot of thinking and personal work” over the past few months.",
            "He also said that he reached out to Rock, who reportedly said he will reach out when he’s ready.",
            "“So I will say to you, Chris, I apologize to you,” Smith said in the video. “My behavior was unacceptable, and I’m here whenever you’re ready to talk.”",

            "We know that big life changes ― layoffs, health events, a new baby ― can cause a lot of stress. However, there are also tiny shifts in our lives (and even our days!) that are often overlooked when it comes to anxiety. Maybe you dread lying down in bed for the night, or maybe the morning rush has you stressed out.",
            "These are called “micro-transitions,” which experts define as smaller moments where something is ending and another event is starting. These can include little points in your day, like the aforementioned bedtime, or slightly bigger events, like a vacation ending.",
            "“Whether it’s called triggers or micro-triggers, we all certainly have things that set us off,” said Jeff Temple, a psychologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch, who adds that sometimes even dreading those transitions can be triggering. “There’s anticipatory anxiety, which is anxiety about being anxious, as opposed to actual things to be anxious about.”",
            "Whether you’ve been officially diagnosed with anxiety or just feel stressed in those moments, there are ways to identify which micro-transitions are toughest for you and strategies for coping.",
            "Here are some micro-transitions to watch out for and what to do to counteract them:",
            "Sunset",
            "Dark thoughts like to show their ugly faces at night, Temple said, so the sun going down or similar evening-related transitions can trigger anxiety.",
            "There are a few theories on why this happens. One study found that sleep disruption can be caused by an inability to control emotionally negative information at night. Some psychologists blame our caveman-esque brains, which used to scan for danger before bed in hunter-gatherer times. Additionally, our brains’ active “negativity bias” ― where our minds subconsciously focus on bad news over good news ― can be at play. At night, we can reminisce on various negative events that occurred during the day.",
            "The End Of A Fun Event",
            "Maybe you’ve spent weeks preparing for your upcoming vacation with family, only to obsess over your last day as the end of your trip is approaching.",
            "Temple said this can be caused by having a great time and not wanting it to end, or conversely, having high expectations and feeling like whatever happened wasn’t as fun as you wanted it to be.",
            "“So therefore, there’s a sense of dread or let down,” he said. These emotions can materialize as anxiety that you wouldn’t have felt otherwise.",
            "‘Audience’ Transitions",
            "Do you change how you are parenting when your partner leaves the room and your mother-in-law walks in? Maybe you are stricter, or more laid-back.",
            "Either way, Dr. Whitney Casares, a private practice pediatrician and founder and CEO of the Modern Mamas Club, said that an “audience change” can be a micro-transition that causes anxiety. This can also show up as “putting on a good face” at a party when you aren’t up for it, or feeling like you can’t be your true self around certain peers.",
            "Conflicting Obligations",
            "If you have a Zoom call coming up, and you know your kid will be waking from a nap at the same time or that a repair person is about to arrive, you might feel pulled in two directions at once. Or maybe it’s a slightly bigger scenario: Say you’ve committed to a distant relative’s wedding and you get an invitation in the mail for your friend’s wedding the same weekend.",
            "Dreading this inability to balance obligations or responsibilities can lead to some anxiety around those micro-transitions, Casares explained. Anticipating or worrying about issues that may come up can cause your body to go into fight-or-flight mode.",
            "How To Deal If You Have Anxiety In These Situations",
            "The first step to handling this type of anxiety is identifying the micro-transitions that are triggering to you, which can be easier said than done, Temple explained.",
            "“Some of the hardest parts are recognizing your negative thoughts, or your anxious thoughts ... it’s really difficult. It’s about being ― I really hate this word ― mindful and reflective, and paying attention to your body and your thoughts,” he said, suggesting people write it down when they perceive an “automatic thought” popping up.",
            "These are thoughts that we don’t even notice we are having, like “tonight’s going to suck,” or “I’m not going to be able to sleep tonight because I have to do this tomorrow.” Once we can recognize which thoughts are automatic, we can challenge them, Temple said.",
            "“That’s when you need to back up, and sit down and think about what just happened and what was going on, so then you can figure out what you were thinking,” he said. When you do this, you’ll start to notice a certain time of day, activity or anything in your environment that’s causing your anxiety.",
            "Once you know your micro-transition triggers, you can work to prevent them. Then you can approach those transitions in a relaxed state,Temple said. So if, say, the evening is an anxiety-inducing period of time, practicing sitting down and deep breathing as that time begins can help.",
            "You can also try creating a designated worry time to help compartmentalize your thoughts. This may be especially useful if you feel anxiety before sleep.",
            "“Spend 10 minutes sometime in the mid-morning, not right before you go to bed, and write down every single thing that you are worried or anxious about. Stay seated for 10 minutes,” Temple said.",
            "Later in the day, if something feels worrisome, validate the thought but move it to that worry time. “We’re not saying don’t have that thought, because that’s impossible ... we’re saying you’re allowed to think that, you’re allowed to be anxious about that, just not right now. So let’s make a note and we’ll worry about that tomorrow during worry time,” Temple said.",
            "Finally, know you are not alone in your anxieties, Casares said. For example, in scenario of a Zoom call while your child is napping, “you could fill a colosseum full of parents who might feel this exact same way,” she said. By realizing anyone in your situation might be experiencing the same emotions, you give your feelings some permission and some room to breathe."

            "HINDMAN, Ky. (AP) — Damage to critical infrastructure and the arrival of more heavy rains hampered efforts Sunday to help Kentucky residents hit by recent massive flooding, Gov. Andy Beshear said.",
            "As residents in Appalachia tried to slowly piece their lives back together, flash flood warnings were issued for at least eight eastern Kentucky counties. The National Weather Service said radar indicated up to 4 inches (10.2 centimeters) of rain fell Sunday in some areas, with more rain possible.Beshear said the death toll climbed to 28 on Sunday from last week’s storms, a number he expected to rise significantly and that it could take weeks to find all the victims.As many as 37 people were unaccounted for, according to a daily briefing from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. A dozen shelters were open for flood victims in Kentucky with 388 occupants on Sunday.Gen. Daniel Hokanson, chief of the U.S. National Guard Bureau, told The Associated Press about 400 people have been rescued by National Guard helicopter. He estimated that the guard had rescued close to 20 by boat from hard-to-access areas.At a news conference in Knott County, Beshear praised the fast arrival of FEMA trailers but noted the numerous challenges.“We have dozens of bridges that are out — making it hard to get to people, making it hard to supply people with water,” he said. “We have entire water systems down that we are working hard to get up.”",
            "Beshear said it will remain difficult, even a week from now, to “have a solid number on those accounted for. It’s communications issues — it’s also not necessarily, in some of these areas, having a firm number of how many people were living there in the first place.”",
            "The governor also talked about the selflessness he’s seen among Kentucky residents suffering from the floods.",
            "“Many people that have lost everything but they’re not even getting goods for themselves, they’re getting them for other people in their neighborhoods, making sure that their neighbors are OK,” Beshear said.",
            "Among the stories of survival that continue to emerge, a 17-year-old girl whose home in Whitesburg was flooded Thursday put her dog in a plastic container and swam 70 yards to safety on a neighbor’s roof. Chloe Adams waited hours until daylight before a relative in a kayak arrived and moved them to safety, first taking her dog, Sandy, and then the teenager.",
            "“My daughter is safe and whole tonight,” her father, Terry Adams, said in a Facebook post. “We lost everything today … everything except what matters most.”",
            "On an overcast morning in downtown Hindman, about 200 miles (322 kilometers) southeast of Louisville, a crew cleared debris piled along storefronts. Nearby, a vehicle was perched upside down in Troublesome Creek, now back within its debris-littered banks.",
            "Workers toiled nonstop through mud-caked sidewalks and roads.",
            "“We’re going to be here unless there’s a deluge,” said Tom Jackson, who is among the workers.",
            "Jackson was with a crew from Corbin, Kentucky, where he’s the city’s recycling director, about a two-hour drive from Hindman.",
            "His crew worked all day Saturday, and the mud and debris were so thick that they managed to clear one-eighth of a mile of roadway. The water rushing off the hillsides had so much force that it bent road signs.",
            "“I’ve never seen water like this,” Jackson said.",
            "Attendance was down for the Sunday morning service at Hindman’s First Baptist Church. Parishioners who rarely miss a service were instead back home tending to cleanup duties caused by floodwaters and mud.",
            "The Rev. Mike Caudill said his church has pitched in to help the reeling community, serving meals and setting up tents for people to pick up cleaning and personal hygiene supplies.",
            "Totes filled with clothes and photos were stacked on retired teacher Teresa Perry Reynolds’ front porch, along with furniture too badly damaged to salvage.",
            "“There are memories there,” she said of the family photos she and her husband were able to gather.",

            "OLATHE, Kan. (AP) — A rare Democrat in a deeply Republican state, U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids of Kansas is one of the most vulnerable incumbents seeking reelection this year. In the final months of her congressional campaign, she is focusing on Republicans’ strict opposition to abortion rights.",
            "An online ad she released last week highlights how Amanda Adkins, the Republican favored to emerge from Tuesday’s primary for a rematch with David in November, opposed abortion without exceptions. The ad points to Adkins’ support of an amendment to the Kansas Constitution on the ballot Tuesday that would make clear there is no right to abortion in the states.",
            "“There were a lot of people who would not have known that I have an opponent who is extreme on this issue,” Davids, who beat Adkins in 2020, said in an interview. “It’s not hypothetical anymore.”",
            "That’s a sign of how the Supreme Court’s decision in June to repeal a woman’s federal constitutional right to abortion has scrambled the political dynamics heading into the fall elections, when control of Congress is at stake. A half-dozen of the most vulnerable House members — all of them women, all representing swaths of suburban voters — see the issue as one that could help them win in an otherwise difficult political climate.",
            "In addition to Davids, these incumbents include Reps. Angie Craig of Minnesota, Cindy Axne of Iowa, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, Abigail Spanberger and Elaine Luria of Virginia, and Susan Wilds of Pennsylvania. They all face Republican opponents who support the high court’s abortion ruling. Some are contending with rivals who back efforts to ban abortion in all circumstances, including when the mother’s life is at risk.",
            "It’s unclear whether the focus on abortion alone may be enough to mean reelection for many of these Democrats, who are running at a time of high inflation and frustration with President Joe Biden’s performance.",
            "“In a close, toss-up election, which I think all of these are, it can make a difference,” said national pollster Christine Matthews, a self-described moderate who has worked for Republicans. “It’s not going to be what drives everyone to make a vote choice, but it will drive some people to make a vote choice.”",
            "Twenty-two percent of U.S. adults named abortion or women’s rights in an open-ended question as one of up to five problems they want the government to address in the next year, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in June. That has more than doubled since December.",
            "Since the Supreme Court decision, as state governments have moved to act on abortion rights, AP-NORC polling has found a majority of people in the United States saying they want Congress to pass legislation guaranteeing access to legal abortion nationwide.",
            "Overwhelming majorities also think states should allow abortion in specific cases, including if the health of the pregnant woman is endangered or if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest.",
            "Like those questioned overall, a majority of suburbanites think abortion should be legal in most or all cases, according to AP-NORC polling. Suburbanites also were slightly more likely than city residents and significantly more likely than people living in rural areas to say abortion or women’s rights are among the top issues for the government to address, according to the AP-NORC poll from June.",
            "That’s particularly important in districts such as Axne’s in Iowa, which includes Des Moines’ teeming suburbs. Dallas County, west of Des Moines, has been one of the country’s fastest-growing counties since 2000, with the cornfields from decades ago now covered in new homes, schools and commercial developments.",
            "In an interview, Axne was adamant that she would make abortion a central theme of her campaign. Axne’s GOP opponent is state Rep. Zach Nunn, who indicated in a primary debate that he opposes abortion without exceptions.",
            "“I can’t even believe I have to say this. I have an opponent who would let a woman die to bear a child,” Axne said. “This is crap we don’t see in this country. This is the stuff we talk about in other countries and women not having rights.”",
            "In Michigan, Rep. Elissa Slotkin faces state Sen. Tom Barrett, who supports only an exception to save a woman’s life.",
            "“That’s more extreme than the 1931 law that’s on our books,” Slotkin said in an interview. “So I think that that’s an important contrast to make.”",
            "The Adkins, Barrett and Nunn campaigns did not reply to telephone, email and text messages seeking comment for this story.",
            "In Virginia, Yesli Vega, the Republican challenging Spanberger in a district that spans the suburbs of Washington, D.C., and Richmond, has not dismissed the debunked theory that pregnancy is unlikely in cases of rape. In audio published by Axios late last month, Vega was asked during a campaign event in May whether “it’s harder for a woman to get pregnant if she’s been raped.”",
            "Vega responded, Axios reported, “Maybe, because there’s so much going on in the body. I don’t know. I haven’t seen any studies. But if I’m processing what you’re saying, it wouldn’t surprise me, because it’s not something that’s happening organically. Right? You’re forcing it.”",
            "The answer was reminiscent of what Todd Akin, a Missouri congressman who was the Republican nominee for Senate in 2012, said during that campaign. In discussing his opposition to exceptions for rape victims, Akin claimed, “If it’s legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut the whole thing down.”",
            "The comments were viewed as a major contributor to his loss to Democrat Clare McCaskill, a vulnerable incumbent.",
            "In Virginia, Spanberger released a digital ad last week declaring that Vega’s “views don’t represent Virginia.”",
            "Earlier, Spanberger had said Vega’s comment was “extreme and ignorant” and “horrifying and disrespectful to the millions of American women who have or will become pregnant due to sexual violence.”",
            "One of the Spanberger’s campaign digital posts used this headline: “Republican congressional candidate pulls a Todd Akin on abortion.”",
            "Representatives for Vega did not respond to messages seeking comment.",
            "Some Republicans warn that Democrats risk overplaying their hand.",
            "In Minnesota, for example, Craig is facing Republican Tyler Kistner, whom she narrowly beat in 2020 in a district that covers Minneapolis’ southeastern suburbs.",
            "Craig has begun running digital ads attacking Kistner, who opposes abortion, but would allow for exceptions in cases of rape, incest and to protect the life of the mother.",
            "“Tyler Kistner wants to take away our rights,” a woman’s voice proclaims in an ad.",
            "Kistner consultant Billy Grant said Craig is “trying to scare you” and noted that the Republican’s team is weighing a counter to the attack that portrays him as “pro-life, but who understands both sides.”",
            "“The rest of America really is not a single-issue voter on that and they are concerned about the economy,” Grant said.",

            "LONDON (AP) — Britain’s Prince Charles is facing more questions over his charities after a newspaper reported that one of his funds accepted a 1 million pound ($1.2 million) donation from relatives of Osama bin Laden.",
            "The Sunday Times reported that the Prince of Wales’s Charitable Fund received the money in 2013 from Bakr bin Laden, patriarch of the large and wealthy Saudi family, and his brother Shafiq. Both are half-brothers of the former al-Qaida leader, who was killed by U.S. special forces in Pakistan in 2011.",
            "The newspaper said advisers had urged the heir to the throne not to take the donation.",
            "Charles’ Clarence House office disputed that but confirmed the donation had been made. It said the decision to accept the money was taken by the charity’s trustees, not the prince, and “thorough due diligence was undertaken in accepting this donation.”",
            "The fund’s chairman, Ian Cheshire, also said the donation was agreed “wholly” by the five trustees at the time, and “any attempt to suggest otherwise is misleading and inaccurate.”",

            "Charles, 73, has faced a series of claims about the operation of his charities. Last month the Sunday Times reported he had accepted bags of cash containing $3 million from Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, the former prime minister of Qatar.",
            "London police are currently investigating a separate allegation that people associated with another of the prince’s charities, the Prince’s Foundation, offered to help a Saudi billionaire secure honors and citizenship in return for donations. Clarence House has said Charles had no knowledge of any such offer."

            "The summer box office showed signs of slowing down this weekend as the animated “DC League of Super-Pets” opened in theaters across North America.",
            "The superhero spinoff about Superman’s dog earned $23 million from 4,314 locations, according to studio estimates Sunday. Though slightly less than expected, it was still enough to capture the first-place spot and knock Jordan Peele’s “Nope” into second place in its second weekend.",
            "Analysts had pegged “DC League of Super-Pets” for a $25 million launch, which was on the lower end for animated openings this summer. In June, the $50.6 million for “Lightyear” was considered underwhelming for the $200 million Disney/Pixar movie. Then in early July, Universal’s “Minions: The Rise of Gru” captured $107 million in its first three days.",
            "But “Super-Pets” is more comparable to Universal’s “The Bad Guys,” which netted out with around $97 million domestic after a $23 million opening, and it’s much, much stronger than Paramount’s “Paws of Fury: The Legend of Hank’s” $6.3 million debut several weeks ago.",
            "“This opening is a huge win for DC fans, the box office, WB and our filmmakers,” said Jeff Goldstein, the studio’s president of domestic distribution.",
            "“DC League of Super-Pets” was not intended to be a midsummer release. Originally, “Super-Pets” had been slated for May, while this weekend was reserved for “Black Adam,” Warner Bros.’ other Dwayne Johnson superhero pic. But postproduction delays due to a backup at VFX houses forced “Black Adam” to move back to October. Instead of giving up the prime date, the studio filled the open spot with a family-friendly title with an all-star voice cast, including Kevin Hart, John Krasinski, Keanu Reeves and Kate McKinnon as an evil guinea pig.",
            "“Super-Pets” has several summer vacation weeks left with little significant competition, and the hope is that it will continue to grow steadily thanks to positive feedback from audiences this weekend.",
            "“The interest is red hot,” Goldstein said. “Word of mouth is exceptional.”",
            "Second place went to Universal’s “Nope,” which fell 57% from its debut last weekend and earned an additional $18.6 million. The North American grosses for “Nope” are now sitting at $80.6 million before it begins its international expansion in August.",
            "“Thor: Love and Thunder” took third place with $13.1 million in its fourth weekend, bringing its domestic total to $301.5 million. Its global total is now sitting at $662 million, without a release in China.",
            "“Minions: The Rise of Gru” stuck its heels in fourth place in its fifth weekend with $10.9 million. Worldwide, it has now earned $710.4 million.",
            "And rounding out the top five was “Top Gun: Maverick,” which made an additional $8.2 million in its 10th weekend, bringing its domestic total to $650.1 million.",
            "New theatrical releases were limited this weekend. Focus Features debuted the film “Vengeance” in 998 locations this weekend, where it earned an estimated $1.8 million. B.J. Novak’s directorial debut follows a podcaster (Novak) who travels from New York to west Texas to investigate the death of his girlfriend. The well-reviewed thriller features Issa Rae and Ashton Kutcher. And Bleecker Street opened the Sundance charmer “A Love Song,” starring Wes Studi and Dale Dickey, in four theaters, where it earned an estimated $18,702."

            "The announcement Saturday by Mayor Eric Adams and health Commissioner Ashwin Vasan said as many as 150,000 city residents could be at risk of infection. The declaration will allow officials to issue emergency orders under the city health code and amend code provisions to implement measures to help slow the spread.",
            "In the last two days, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul declared a state disaster emergency declaration and the state health department called monkeypox an “imminent threat to public health.”",
            "New York had recorded 1,345 cases as of Friday, according to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. California had the second-most, with 799.",
            "“We will continue to work with our federal partners to secure more doses as soon as they become available,” Adams and Vasan said in the statement. “This outbreak must be met with urgency, action, and resources, both nationally and globally, and this declaration of a public health emergency reflects the seriousness of the moment.”",
            "The World Health Organization declared monkeypox a global health emergency on July 23 and San Francisco’s mayor on Thursday announced a state of emergency over the growing number of cases.",
            "The once-rare disease has been established in parts of central and west Africa for decades but was not known to spark large outbreaks beyond the continent or to spread widely among people until May, when authorities detected dozens of epidemics in Europe, North America and elsewhere.",
            "To date, there have been more than 22,000 monkeypox cases reported in nearly 80 countries since May, with about 75 suspected deaths in Africa, mostly in Nigeria and Congo. On Friday, Brazil and Spain reported deaths linked to monkeypox, the first reported outside Africa. Spain reported a second monkeypox death Saturday.",
            "The virus spreads through prolonged and close skin-to-skin contact as well as sharing bedding, towels and clothing. In Europe and North America, it has spread primarily among men who have sex with men, though health officials emphasize that the virus can infect anyone.",
            "The type of monkeypox virus identified in this outbreak is rarely fatal, and people usually recover within weeks. But the lesions and blisters caused by the virus are painful."

            "The 23-ton rocket had launched from China’s Hainan Island on July 24 to carry a new module to China’s Tiangong space station, a station that remains under construction, Space.com reported.",

            "The Aerospace Corporation’s Center for Orbital and Reentry Debris Studies expected about 5 to 9 metric tons of the rocket stage would “survive reentry and reach the Earth’s surface.”",

            "The FBI arrested James W. Clark of Falmouth, Massachusetts, on Friday for allegedly threatening to explode a bomb in the “personal space” of Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs if the Democrat did not resign in the weeks after the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol, according to NBC Boston.",
            "According to the indictment against him, Clark researched “how to kill” Hobbs in February 2021. The 38-year-old also allegedly searched online “fema Boston marathon bombing” and “fema Boston marathon bombing plan digital army” before sending Arizona’s Elections Division a felony threat through their online contact form.",
            "“Your attorney general needs to resign by Tuesday, February 16th by 9 a.m. or the explosive device impacted in her personal space will be detonated,” Clark wrote, according to prosecutors.",
            "The threat was sent on Feb. 21, 2021, and seemingly made as a result of Hobbs’ role in certifying the 2020 presidential election. Former President Donald Trump infamously contended it was stolen despite dozens of state and federal judges dismissing his lawsuits.",
            "“All of us here today do not want to see our election victory stolen by emboldened radical-left Democrats, which is what they’re doing,” said Trump in his Jan. 6 speech before the Capitol riots, according to NPR. “And stolen by the fake news media. That’s what they’ve done and what they’re doing. We will never give up, we will never concede.”",
            "Despite receiving hundreds of threats on some days and none on others, the harassment ebbing and flowing, Clark’s was the only bomb threat she received, Hobbs spokeswoman Murphy Hebert told NBC Boston.",
            "“The FBI takes all threat-to-life matters very seriously,” said Chris Ormerod, the acting special agent in charge of the Phoenix field office. “While this arrest demonstrates the FBI’s commitment to hold accountable anyone who tries to intimidate a public official, it also shows that people cannot threaten others with violent and physical harm without repercussions.”",
            "Trump lost to then-presidential candidate Joe Biden by more than 10,000 votes in Arizona.",
            "It remains unclear whether Clark found a lawyer or is still in custody after Friday’s arrest.",
            "If found guilty of making a bomb threat, Clark faces up to 10 years in prison. According to the three-count indictment, he was also charged with one count of communicating an interstate threat and one count of perpetrating a bomb hoax, each of which carries a sentence of up to five years.",
            "Intelligence agencies and election officials across the country continue to receive similar threats, said Hobbs.",
            "Attorney General Merrick Garland even formed an Election Threats Task Force in June 2021 to more thoroughly investigate such activities.",
            "“Election officials across the country are being threatened regularly for doing their jobs,” Hobbs said in a statement Friday, according to NBC News. “It’s unconscionable and undermines our democracy. This harassment won’t be tolerated and can’t be normalized. We thank the FBI for their persistence on further investigating this incident.”"

            "LAS VEGAS (AP) — Intense summer thunderstorms that drenched parts of Las Vegas — causing water to cascade from casino ceilings and pool on the carpet of a stadium-sized sports betting area — were part of a broad regional monsoon pattern that may repeat through the weekend, a National Weather Service official said Friday.",
            "“We’re getting right into the heart of the most active part,” said John Adair, a veteran meteorologist at the weather service office near Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas. “This is turning out to be a pretty active monsoon season, compared with the last five years or so. There’s plenty of more opportunities for thunderstorms to develop.”",
            "The annual weather pattern has brought a parade of storms across the U.S. Southwest in recent weeks that lead to flooding in normally dry washes, rain measured in inches and rescue operations.",
            "In Arizona, a driver had to be rescued from a vehicle caught in floodwaters in Apache Junction. A youth conservation crew abandoned the red truck they were riding in at Canyon de Chelly National Monument on the Navajo Nation when it got stuck in the mud and water rose around it. Mohave County sheriff’s officials rescued a woman who was clinging to a stop sign earlier this week after her car was swept away.",
            "Parts of the Hualapai Mountains in Mohave County have received up to 6 inches (15.2 centimeters) of rain in recent days, Adair said. The National Weather Service said parts of Arizona can expect 1 (2.5 centimeters) to 2 (5 centimeters) inches of rain per hour before a flood watch expired Saturday morning.",
            "While the rain is welcome in a region gripped by drought, it creates headaches for neighborhoods where wildfires have stripped the land of vegetation, which normally slows and partially absorbs floodwaters.",
            "New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said Thursday the Federal Emergency Management Agency granted a request to include effects of flooding and mudslides in certain counties hit by massive wildfires this year to the state’s disaster declaration.",
            "In northern Arizona, Flagstaff residents have grown accustomed to constant alerts on cell phones and sirens in neighborhoods warning of imminent flooding.",
            "Bret Henneman estimates he has about 3,500 sandbags around his home just north of Flagstaff where two wildfires burned this spring. His wife was babysitting and had the back door open two weeks ago when heavy rain fell and sent a few inches of rain and mud through the home.",
            "With every flood alert, they now cringe.",
            "“We still need the rains and all that and we really need the monsoons around here,” said Henneman, who is staying with family while his house dries out. “It’s just that wildfires have changed everything. So, yeah, when it does rain, we’re in fear.”",
            "Parts of Arizona, including the towns of Heber, Show Low, Bellemont and Prescott, are near or above 200% of normal rainfall so far during the monsoon, which started June 15 and runs through September. The weather pattern is hit-and-miss, though, meaning some places like Payson are far below normal.",
            "“There’s not really a good explanation for why that occurs, but that’s part of the nature of storms,” said Valerie Meola, a meteorologist with the weather service in Flagstaff.",
            "Jacquetta Brown was walking on a trail in Canyon de Chelly near Chinle, Arizona, this week when heavy rain swept through and she spotted the red truck partially submerged. The rain is a blessing for crops that families plant in the canyon and livestock, she said, but the monsoon also comes with a downside.",
            "“We have dirt roads here, and when we can’t cross the wash, we can’t get to work and school,” Brown said.",
            "While only 0.3 inch (0.76 centimeters) of rain was registered at the Las Vegas airport late Thursday, more than 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) fell just 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) away at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Adair said.",
            "Nearby wind gusts peaked at 71 mph (114 kph) and toppled trees. Pea-sized hail fell from lightning-streaked skies in suburban Henderson, where almost 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) of rain fell in some areas.",
            "Police, county and city officials and the weather service said no injuries or widespread damage was reported.",
            "Casino patrons posted videos of water pouring from ceilings at Caesars Palace and Planet Hollywood resorts on the Las Vegas Strip and from behind a huge video display at the downtown Circa hotel-casino sports book. One video showed a man continuing to gamble at a casino slot machine while water fell around him.",
            "“A night we’ll never forget,” Circa owner Derek Stevens said in a Twitter post.",
            "“Last night’s weather took Vegas by storm and we were no exception,” Stevens said Friday. “But the show must go on and I’m happy to share that repairs are underway.”",
            "Roped-off sports book seats were expected to reopen during the weekend, he said.",
            "Rapid runoff from sunbaked lots flooded street intersections, prompting vehicles to creep through high water near Las Vegas Boulevard and Main Street. Flood-control channels turned to roiling torrents. Scattered power outages were reported in places including the downtown Fremont Street Experience casino pedestrian mall.",
            "Las Vegas firefighters responded to 330 calls for service and swift-water teams rescued seven people between 9 p.m. and midnight, city spokesman Jace Radke said. Clark County firefighters responded to six water rescue calls, county spokeswoman Stacey Welling said.",
            "Adair said the Las Vegas area usually receives around 4.2 inches (10.7 centimeters) of rain per year, but the official measuring station at the airport has recorded less than 0.7 inch (1.8 centimeters) in 2022.",
            "The surface level at the region’s drought-stricken water supply — the Lake Mead reservoir behind Hoover Dam on the Colorado River — has dropped to less than 30%.",
            "While runoff from storms in the Las Vegas area will reach the lake, monsoon moisture is not likely to affect the ongoing regional drought, Adair said.",
            "“For that, we generally rely on the winter season, where we get multiple Pacific storms coming in and covering a wide area with rain and snow,” the meteorologist said. “That can make a significant impact on drought.”",

            "Olivia Troye, a former Department of Homeland Security and counterterrorism adviser to former Vice President Mike Pence, said Friday there’s a reason she “went very public” about quitting her job in 2020 ― and suggested current investigations into the missing Secret Service text messages involve the same person.",
            "Troye appeared on CNN as part of a panel alongside former CIA agent Phil Mudd and government ethics expert Norm Eisen when she made these claims. News anchor Jim Sciutto asked Troye why the missing messages, which are linked to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, weren’t actively preserved.",
            "“It’s a little surprising,” said Troye. “I have worked technical migrations in the government, and I find it a little bit confusing that people were not aware that these messages were going to disappear, especially with the amount of planning that goes into these migrations. I can tell you that firsthand having done it.”",
            "While DHS Inspector General Joseph Cuffari’s office planned to contact all Homeland Security agencies to assist in recovering the missing messages in February 2021, sources told The Washington Post it decided not to collect the phones or review any data later that month.",
            "“I came from DHS,” Troye told CNN. “When you work at the senior levels in the Trump administration … you know exactly where people’s loyalties lie. I know [Ken] Cuccinelli and Chad Wolf and all these people and Cuffari very well.” (Cuccinelli and Wolf were the acting leaders at DHS at the time.)",
            "Cuffari notably waited more than one year to report that messages were missing to the House Jan. 6 committee. However, he first learned of the messages in May 2021 — seven months before alerting them, according to CNN.",
            "Troye, who famously quit the Trump administration in 2020 over its lacking COVID-19 pandemic response, then linked that experience to the DHS inspector general’s office ― which was led by Cuffari at the time.",
            "“There is a reason that I went very public with my concerns about the Trump administration, rather than going through the traditional whistleblower process, which would have led me through the inspector general’s office at DHS,” Troye said Friday on CNN.",
            "“And I’ll just say that. So, there’s a level of trust there that you understand.”",
            "As for the missing messages, the texts were seemingly lost when the Secret Service switched devices and migrated to a new internal data system.",
            "A senior forensics analyst in Cuffari’s office had already prepared to collect some of the relevant phones when one of the deputies who “report to Cuffari’s team” emailed investigators on Feb. 18 and instructed them not to move forward, sources told The Washington Post.",
            "“I’ve got to tell you, being a Trump admin person, most of the administration communicated on encrypted signal apps, apps like Signal,” said Troye. “So, a lot of the times, these messages were likely disappearing. So ... it’s a little bit suspect.”",
            "Troye went on to add: “You can either turn in your government phone ― was there an encrypted app on it? Was it on their personal phone? In any case, it seems these messages are gone either way.”",
            "Mudd, a CNN counterterrorism analyst, called the handling of the situation “beyond incompetence.” Mudd joined the CIA in 1985 as an analyst specializing in the Middle East and South Asia during President Ronald Reagan’s administration.",
            "“How can the inspector general go to Congress now and say that you can trust me to conduct ongoing investigations when there are these gaps of reporting to you? I think the inspector general has to go,” Mudd said.",
            "“What the heck was the chief information officer at DHS doing?” Mudd added. “If you’re migrating data, the first question you have for someone who grew up with a manual typewriter is, is that data backed up? Not only because you are supposed to do that, but because the law says you have to do that.”",
            "Eisen, a CNN legal analyst, went even further in suggesting that the Justice Department is “undoubtedly” considering serious penalties for those potentially involved in the alleged negligence — or possible cover-up on behalf of the Trump administration.",
            "“How many coincidences are we going to have involving DHS and the Secret Service and these missing messages on the most crucial period of time that our nation has confronted in decades?” Eisen asked.",
            "“I mean, it just strains belief,” he added. “We don’t want to prejudge, but [the] DOJ is undoubtedly taking a hard look at some of the federal penalties that can include criminal penalties if we find that this was not an accident, that it was not negligence, that was not coincidence after coincidence — but something intentional was going on here.”"

            "Nicholas Sandmann lost his defamation lawsuits against several major media companies on Tuesday.",
            "The teenager, who was 16 when a video of him and Native American elder Nathan Phillips went viral in 2019, plans to appeal the ruling after a federal judge struck his cases against The New York Times, ABC News, NBC Universal Media, CBS News, Gannett and Rolling Stone, according to Insider.",
            "Court documents showed the lawsuit centered on Phillips’ claims that Sandmann blocked his path. These claims were widely reported on by major outlets including CNN and The Washington Post, both of which Sandmann eventually sued and settled with for undisclosed sums in 2020.",
            "The encounter itself occurred at the Indigenous People’s March in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 18, 2019. Footage showed Sandmann and fellow students from Covington Catholic High School in Kentucky, who participated in the anti-abortion March for Life, coming across Phillips and other Native Americans at the Lincoln Memorial.",
            "One video showed Phillips playing a drum as Sandmann stood before him with a smile on his face. Some of the students wore “MAGA” hats, with others interrupting the Indigenous meetup by raucously yelling and dancing to the music.",
            "The footage went viral, and many saw Sandmann’s self-assured smile as a mockery of the event.",
            "Phillips claimed in subsequent interviews that Sandmann blocked him from moving. Sandmann claimed in 2020 that he was actually trying to “defuse the situation” by “remaining motionless and calm,” according to CNN.",
            "While further footage emerged on Jan. 19 that showed a separate group yelled offenses at the Indigenous group before Phillips even approached Sandmann, the initial video unwittingly made the teenager famous — with extensive punditry on major news outlets spurring him to sue.",
            "Federal Judge William O. Bertelsmann summarized in court on Tuesday that Sandmann’s arguments regarding any potential defamation were “objectively unverifiable and thus unactionable claims,” however.",
            "“The media defendants were covering a matter of great public interest, and they reported Phillips’s first-person view of what he experienced,” said Bertelsmann. “This would put the reader on notice that Phillips was simply giving his perspective on the incident.”",
            "Bertelsmann, who acknowledged that Sandmann’s case was filed during nationwide racial tension, clarified Tuesday that his ruling was made “with no consideration of the rancorous political debate associated with these cases.”",
            "Sandmann, who delivered a pre-recorded speech at the Republican National Convention in 2020 and had then-President Donald Trump claim he was “smeared by the media,” responded to the ruling with a Twitter thread on Wednesday.",
            "“Obviously, the ruling yesterday was a disappointment for my family and I,” tweeted Sandmann. “I’m appealing the decision in the sixth circuit. Here’s why: Judge Bertelsmann revisited the statements that I ‘blocked Nathan Phillips’ and ‘would not allow him to retreat.’”",
            "“His job was to rule on the legal issue of what those statements were,” Sandmann continued. “If they were factual claims, I could proceed and a jury would then decide if they were defamatory. But if they were opinions, it is protected speech that I cannot sue for.” Sandmann maintained that the media outlets’ claims were facts, not opinions, and thus grounds for a suit."

            "As the Alabama Department of Corrections prepared to execute Joe Nathan James Jr. on Thursday night, against the wishes of his victim’s family members, an agency official told a journalist that she would not be allowed to witness the killing because her skirt was too short.",
            "The journalist, AL.com’s Ivana Hrynkiw, had worn the skirt to previous executions “without incident,” she wrote in a statement. Even after pulling the skirt down to her hips to make the hemline fall lower, she was still told it was “not appropriate,” she wrote. Determined to do her job, Hrynkiw borrowed waterproof fisherman’s wader pants from a photographer she had never met, stuffing the suspenders under her shirt to keep the pants from falling down.",
            "The Department of Corrections spokesperson determined this was a more professional outfit, but proceeded to take issue with Hrynkiw’s open-toe high-heeled shoes, claiming they were “too revealing.” After changing into tennis shoes she had in her car, Hrynkiw was finally permitted to cover the execution.",
            "“This was an uncomfortable situation, and I felt embarrassed to have my body and my clothes questioned in front of a room of people I mostly had never met,” Hrynkiw wrote. I sat down, tried to stop blushing, and did my work. As women often have to do.”",
            "Another reporter who was present, Lee Hedgepeth, of the local CBS affiliate, confirmed on Thursday that the department told a reporter her skirt was too short to witness the execution, prompting her to borrow pants from a colleague.",
            "The Alabama Department of Corrections did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
            "Media witnesses serve a vital role in bringing a modicum of transparency to executions, which are shrouded in secrecy. Corrections departments typically keep secret the identities of the executioners and the source of the drugs used — which are sometimes purchased in cash to avoid a paper trail. The few media witnesses allowed in the room bear witness to state-sponsored killings, alerting the public to unusual delays, breakdowns in protocol and signs of pain — although autopsies of individuals who have been executed suggest that even those who appear to have died peacefully may have experienced torturously painful deaths. Observations from media witnesses have been used in federal litigation challenging the constitutionality of execution protocols.",
            "Corrections departments heavily restrict media access to executions, typically allowing only a small number of pre-selected journalists in the room. They are often only let in the room after the individual being killed has been strapped down to the gurney, sometimes with an obstructed view of the killing. Witnessing executions is a traumatic experience, and the journalists who do it describe feeling incredible pressure to accurately capture details while watching someone be killed.",
            "On Thursday, Hrynkiw had to do that difficult work, wearing ill-fitting clothes loaned to her by a stranger, while a government official policed her appearance in front of her colleagues.",
            "Because of Hrynkiw and the other witnesses to James’ execution, we know the killing was delayed by more than three hours and that the Alabama Department of Corrections has refused to explain why. On Friday, after multiple inquiries from reporters, the agency put out a vague statement suggesting there was an issue setting the intravenous lines.",
            "The state killed James by lethal injection as punishment for killing his ex-girlfriend Faith Hall in 1994. Earlier this month, Hall’s daughter and several family members asked Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R) to stay the execution. Ivey denied the request and James was pronounced dead at 9:27 p.m. on Thursday.",
            "“Justice has been served,” Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall claimed after the killing.",
            "But Hall’s family members, who declined to attend the execution, didn’t see it that way. “We hoped the state wouldn’t take a life simply because a life was taken and we have forgiven Mr. Joe Nathan James Jr. for his atrocities toward our family,” they said in a statement."

            "This September will mark Kenan Thompson’s record-setting 20th season on “SNL,” but he’s not sure how much longer that will last.",
            "Not that Thompson wants to leave, but he can see a future where the long-running variety show is no longer on the air ― and it could be sooner than you think.",
            "The 44-year-old comedian recently appeared on Charlamagne The God’s “Hell Of A Week” interview show where he addressed long-standing rumors that “SNL” creator Lorne Michaels might leave the show after its 50th anniversary season in 2024-25.",
            "Thompson, the longest-running cast member in the show’s history, thinks Michaels’ departure could logically mean the end of the show itself ― and he’s OK with it.",
            "“There could be a lot of validity to that rumor, because 50 is a good number to stop at,” Thompson went on. “That’s an incredible package. He will be, probably, close to 80 years old at that point, and you know, he’s the one who’s had his touch on the whole thing.”",
            "Thompson thinks that Michaels’ departure might give NBC an excuse to “slash the budget” ― and that could affect the quality.",
            "“At that point, you can’t really do the same kind of show,” Thompson said. “So that’s unfair to watch it just really go down kind of in flames for real because of those restrictions … Capping it at 50 might not be a bad idea,” he said.",
            "“[Michaels] is such a legend that he keeps off those corporate wolves, if you will,” Thompson said. “They spend a lot of money on that show every week. It’s an expensive show, but it’s a one-of-a-kind thing.”",
            "Michaels started the “cap it at 50” rumors last December when he told CBS that he’s committed to “SNL” through the 50th anniversary.",
            "“I have a feeling that’d be a really good time to leave,” Michaels said. “But here’s the point: I won’t want the show ever to be bad. I care too deeply about it. It’s been my life’s work. So, I’m gonna do everything I can to see it carry on and carry on well.”"

            "UVALDE, Texas (AP) — The principal of the Texas school where the nation’s deadliest classroom shooting in a decade happened was reinstated Thursday, three days after she was suspended with pay in the wake of security criticisms leveled by a legislative committee.",
            "Mandy Gutierrez, who Uvalde school district officials suspended with pay Monday as Robb Elementary School principal, was reinstated Thursday in a brief letter from Superintendent Hal Harrell.",
            "The reinstatement came after Gutierrez, in a letter to the committee members, disputed the key findings that a “culture of complacency” had developed at the school that allowed a gunman to enter the school and kill 19 children and two teachers. She also said the lock on the door to the fourth-grade classroom where the May 24 shooting happened worked when a custodian checked it the night before.",
            "Harrell suspended Gutierrez with pay on Monday pending a performance review pertaining to school security. However, in his Thursday letter, Harrell said she would be allowed to return to work immediately “and will continue to serve the district in an administrative capacity.”",
            "The legislative report placed the most fault with local, state and federal law enforcement agencies, which took more than an hour to enter the classroom where the shooter was and kill him as parents outside the school begged officers to do something and dispatchers took 911 calls from inside the school. Surveillance footage of police officers in body armor milling in the hallway while the gunman carried out the massacre led to rage from families of victims, who have demanded accountability.",

            "AUSTIN, Texas ― A longtime sidekick for conspiracy theorist Alex Jones took the stand Thursday in a trial that will determine how much Jones and his Infowars website will have to pay a pair of Sandy Hook Elementary parents whose child was killed in the 2012 school massacre.",
            "Attorney Kyle Farrar questioned an Infowars show host, Owen Shroyer, who’s been with the conspiracy outlet since 2016, over the responsibility Infowars had to vet its information before presenting it as fact to an audience of potentially millions of listeners.",
            "Farrar paid particular attention to a 2017 video of Shroyer in which he presented as fact a fake story about the Sandy Hook massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, that was published on the blog ZeroHedge. (U.S. intelligence officials have accused ZeroHedge of publishing Kremlin propaganda.)",
            "The story in question, by an anonymous user named “ZeroPointNow,” portrayed father Neil Heslin as a liar when he recalled holding his dead son Jesse’s body in a separate interview with NBC News’ Megyn Kelly.",
            "“I lost my son. I buried my son. I held my son with a bullet hole through his head,” Heslin told Kelly in the June 2017 segment.",
            "A jury will soon decide how much money Jones and Infowars will have to pay Heslin and Scarlett Lewis for the pain and harassment they’ve endured because of Jones repeatedly saying the shooting was fake.",
            "Shroyer told viewers in the 2017 Infowars’ segment that “fact checkers” said ZeroHedge’s story had merit. Yet on the stand Thursday, Shroyer admitted he has no idea who “ZeroPointNow” is. And the fact-checker he referenced on that episode was Jim Fetzer, author of the book “Nobody Died at Sandy Hook.”",
            "“You did zero to determine if the story was accurate, right?” asked Farrar.",
            "“Correct,” said Shroyer. He later acknowledged, “I could have done a better job.”",
            "“You could have done A job,” Farrar shot back. “You could have done something.”",
            "Shroyer’s testimony Thursday followed two days of questioning of Daria Karpova, an Infowars producer who repeatedly deflected, claimed ignorance and rambled, until at one point District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble interrupted her with a pointed instruction: “You need to focus on the question you’re asked, not just what you feel like saying.”",
            "In his opening statement Tuesday for the plaintiffs, attorney Mark Bankston laid out the lies Jones and his conspiracy website Infowars spread about the shooting.",
            "“Jones told his audience that [Barack] Obama staged Sandy Hook ― and not that Obama ordered the murder of those children but that there were never even children at all,” Bankston said. “Jones said the school was fake, the parents liars, paid actors. The funerals fake, their tears fake.”Jones already lost his case in September after Gamble rendered a default judgment against Jones for failing to provide court-ordered documents related to the case.Bankston asked a jury Tuesday to award Heslin and Lewis $150 million in damages.Jones was repeatedly in and out of the courtroom Thursday, flanked by four private bodyguards.Jones previously told the court he would be unable to attend parts of the trial because of a medical condition, yet Farrar noted he’s been on the air constantly throughout the week, complaining about the trial and urging viewers to buy more supplements. Jones smoked cigarettes outside of the courthouse during the breaks.Gamble also warned both Jones and Shroyer on Thursday that they are not to discuss the case outside of the courtroom after they went on Infowars to talk about the trial.Attorney Andino Reynal, who is representing Jones, was seen giving a middle finger to Bankston at the end of court Wednesday. He apologized to the court on Thursday but was reprimanded again later that day for claiming he didn’t know his clients couldn’t discuss the case outside the court.“Because you’re just a brand new lawyer, right?” Gamble shot back. “Enough with the ‘Aw shucks, I don’t know the rules of the court.’”"

            "For those who haven’t listened to the leak (or been hunted down by the Beyhive), “Renaissance,” the new and highly anticipated seventh solo studio album from Beyoncé, arrives on Friday.",
            "To commemorate the release, the music superstar has shared an open letter on her website to fans, which contains a never-before-seen photo of her three children with her husband Jay-Z.",
            "In the adorable selfie, Beyonce cuddles in bed with Blue, 10, Rumi, 5, and Sir, 5, who are all fast asleep.",
            "“I want to give a special thank you to Rumi, Sir and Blue for allowing me the space, creativity, and inspiration,” she wrote in the message. “And a special thanks to my husband and muse, who held me down during those late nights in the studio.”",
            "The singer explained that she worked on the “three-act project” for three years. Forever keeping us on our toes, Beyoncé has yet to reveal exactly what the other two acts will contain.",
            "“Creating this album allowed me a place to dream and find escape during a scary time for the world,” she wrote. “To feel free and adventurous in a time when little else was moving. My intention was to create a safe place, a place without judgment. A place to be free of perfectionism and overthinking. A place to scream, release and feel freedom. It was a beautiful journey of exploration.”",
            "She went on to honor her late Uncle Johnny, who was gay and died from complications related to an AIDS diagnosis, as a major influence on the album’s sound. “He was my godmother and the first person to expose me to a lot of the music and the culture that serve as an inspiration for this album,” she wrote before highlighting, “all of the pioneers who originate culture” and “fallen angels whose contributions have gone unrecognized for so long.” Many have noted how the album’s vibrant lead single “Break My Soul,” which was released last month to much critical acclaim, celebrates house music’s Black queer origins. The track, of course, opens with the unmistakable voice of the legendary queer icon Big Freedia, who is known as the Queen of Bounce, a genre of hip-hop music that originated in New Orleans, Louisiana. “I hope you find joy in this music,” Beyoncé concluded her note. “I hope it inspires you to release the wiggle. And to feel as unique, strong and sexy as you are.”She also thanked her parents Tina Knowles-Lawson and Matthew Knowles, whom she called her “first teacher” that inspires “every move that I make.”“Renaissance” arrives in all its glory on July 29."

            "The climate and clean energy provisions in the surprise reconciliation package Democrats announced late Thursday are far smaller than the $555 billion in climate spending eyed in the initial “Build Back Better” plan that President Joe Biden unveiled last year.",
            "Still, at a whopping $369 billion, it would be the most significant investment the U.S. has ever made to confront fossil fuel-driven climate breakdown and its mounting impacts.",
            "“This will be, by far, the biggest climate action in human history,” Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said in a statement shortly after Democrats struck the deal. “The planet is on fire. Emissions reductions are the main thing. This is enormous progress. Let’s get it done.”",
            "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said it will be “the greatest pro-climate legislation that has ever been passed by Congress.” And in Thursday remarks at the White House, Biden called it “the most significant legislation in history to tackle the climate crisis and improve our energy security right away.”",
            "The new agreement, now dubbed the Inflation Reduction Act and which is expected to come up for a vote as early as next week, would set the U.S. on course to slash its greenhouse gas emissions 40% by 2030, according to the one-page summary of the bill. The package comes on the heels of an analysis that found without additional policy actions, the U.S. is on pace to reduce planet-warming emissions 24% to 35% below 2005 levels by the end of the decade — far short of Biden’s 50% to 52% goal.",
            "The bill includes more than 100 climate and energy provisions. The bulk of the spending comes in the form of clean energy tax credits, grants and loans. It provides $30 billion in incentives for companies to manufacture solar panels, wind turbines and batteries, as well as to process critical minerals. There’s another $10 billion in tax credits for the construction of new clean technology manufacturing facilities, up to $20 billion in loans to build clean vehicle manufacturing plants, and $500 million in Defense Production Act funds for heat pumps and critical minerals processing.",
            "The package would lower the cost of electric vehicles for low- and middle-income Americans, with $7,500 tax credits for new EVs and $4,500 for used ones, and invest billions to electrify low-income households.",
            "Additionally, the bill earmarks $60 billion to confront legacy pollution and invest in low-income and communities of color; $27 billion for a so-called “green bank” to boost clean energy and slash emissions, with a particular focus on disadvantaged communities; $20 billion for climate-friendly agriculture; and $5 billion in forest conservation grants.",
            "It would also establish a fee on emissions of methane, an extremely potent greenhouse gas that is released from a number of sources, including oil and gas operations.",
            "Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) shocked Democrats and Republicans alike on Thursday when he gave his blessing to the scaled-down, $740 billion spending package, which will raise taxes on the ultra-wealthy to pay for investments in both climate and health care. The decision came just two weeks after Manchin, who has proven himself a relentless thorn in Democrats’ side, seemingly torpedoed what was widely seen as a last chance for the party to pass meaningful climate legislation.",
            "In a lengthy statement Thursday and a subsequent interview Friday with West Virginia radio host Hoppy Kercheval, Manchin made it clear that his support hinged on support for fossil fuels.",
            "“The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 invests in the technologies needed for all fuel types ― from hydrogen, nuclear, renewables, fossil fuels and energy storage ― to be produced and used in the cleanest way possible,” he said in his statement. “It is truly all of the above, which means this bill does not arbitrarily shut off our abundant fossil fuels.”",
            "Among other things, the bill would reinstate oil and gas leases that companies obtained during a November 2021 auction and which a federal judge later vacated after concluding that the Biden administration had failed to properly account for the climate impacts of the lease sale. It also ties future renewable energy projects on federal lands to ongoing oil and gas development, requiring the Interior Department to offer at auction at least 2 million acres onshore and 60 million acres offshore to oil and gas interests before it can proceed with wind, solar and other renewable lease sales.",
            "Manchin also said he received a commitment from Biden, Leader Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to reform the federal permitting process for energy infrastructure, including pipelines.",
            "“I’m saying straight to you, without permitting reforms, without the ability for America to do what it does best — produce — there is no bill,” Manchin told Kercheval on Friday. “That is totally agreed upon and understood.”",
            "Even with those fossil fuel concessions, climate advocates and environmental groups largely celebrated the package. Leah Stokes, a climate policy expert at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who has advised Democrats during the negotiations, called it a “game changer.”",
            "“It would bring clean energy jobs to America and lower energy bills for American families,” Stokes wrote on Twitter. “It would get us 80% of the way to President Biden’s climate goal.”",
            "But some green groups, including 350.org and Center for Biological Diversity, couldn’t see past the oil and gas mandates.",
            "“This is a climate suicide pact,” Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. “It’s self-defeating to handcuff renewable energy development to massive new oil and gas extraction. The new leasing required in this bill will fan the flames of the climate disasters torching our country, and it’s a slap in the face to the communities fighting to protect themselves from filthy fossil fuels.”"

            "The sheriff’s department in Houston released body camera footage last weekend that shows a deputy holding down a Black man and fatally shooting him at close range after receiving 911 calls about an alleged shoplifting and assault at a Dollar General store.",
            "Sgt. Garrett Hardin of the Harris County Sheriff’s Office pinned Roderick Brooks to the ground on July 8 after a foot chase and shot him, the video shows. Sadiyah Evangelista Karriem, an attorney for Brooks’ family, told HuffPost that the deputy shot the 47-year-old near where his head and neck met.",
            "Brooks’ family has alleged police brutality and misuse of force, and on Tuesday called for the Texas Rangers and U.S. Department of Justice to investigate the shooting.",
            "They believe the law enforcement footage tells only part of the story. Demetria Brooks-Glaze, Brooks’ sister, said witnesses told the family that the officer hit Brooks several times and that it was not shown in body camera footage released by the department.",
            "“The world needs to see what they are doing. In this case, they are not showing everything,” she said, calling the shooting a “racist act.”",
            "“What gives you the right to take someone’s life by shooting them in the back of the head and neck?” Brooks-Glaze added.",
            "Law enforcement said security video, which has not been released to the public, shows Brooks arriving at the Dollar General and then leaving without paying for items he grabbed from the shelves. A female employee confronted him at the exit, according to police.",
            "At 6:04 p.m., the Harris County Sheriff’s Office received a call from a woman who said a “Black man in a blue shirt, gray shorts and baseball cap” had taken items from the store without paying and hit her.",
            "“A customer is running out of the store and he hit me on the way out,” the woman said during the 911 call, a recording of which has been released by the police. “He pushed my arm out of the way.”",
            "The woman said she did not need emergency medical services.",
            "“I just want him to get arrested because he is literally running to the back of the building right now,” she told the dispatcher.",
            "The woman later told the dispatcher that she didn’t believe the man had a weapon, and she did not think he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The dispatcher asked if the deputies would face any threats once they arrived on the scene, and the woman said no.",
            "One man called 911 twice, saying had seen a man leave the store with detergent and alleging the man had “pushed a lady down” on his way out.",
            "Footage released by the police shows Hardin approaching Brooks in his car and stopping in front of a gas station.",
            "“Come here, dude,” the officer says as he leaves his vehicle. He then chases Brooks through the parking lot.",
            "“Stop, dude, I’m going to tase you!” Hardin says.",
            "He tells Brooks to get on the ground several times.",
            "The officer then stuns Brooks, taking him to the ground. The footage goes dark briefly. When it returns, Brooks is on the ground and the officer has his hand on his neck. The stun gun is on the ground, close to Brooks’ head.",
            "“Why did you tase me?” Brooks asks Hardin. “Please get off me, man.”",
            "The two begin to struggle. While pinned to the ground, Brooks grabs the Taser in front of him.",
            "“I’m going to shoot you. Put that down,” Hardin says. “I will fucking shoot you.”",
            "The body camera footage shows that Brooks did not point the Taser toward the officer, and that he let go of it while Hardin reached for his gun.",
            "Hardin then shot Brooks in the base of his head and neck while holding him to the ground.",
            "Attorneys representing Brooks’ family are also working to file a lawsuit against Harris County Sheriff’s Office and Hardin.",
            "“This is what we see when we continuously have a lack of honest policing in this country. It is a failure from top to bottom,” Justin Moore, an attorney representing Brooks’ family, told HuffPost. “Roderick should be alive today if it wasn’t for the rogue officer to be out here in these streets.”",
            "“What we saw on raw footage shows the officer was fully out of control and failed to follow policy,” Moore added.",

            "“The Taser issue is a red herring, and if you see the video, he grabs the Taser but he releases it multiple times,” Moore said. “He never grabs it and points it at the officer. He tried to get it to stop electrocuting him.”",

            "ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — The last two former Minneapolis police officers who were convicted of violating George Floyd’s civil rights during his May 2020 killing were sentenced Wednesday in federal court to three and 3 1/2 years — penalties that a judge said reflected their level of culpability in a case that sparked worldwide protests as part of a reckoning over racial injustice.",
            "J. Alexander Kueng was sentenced to three years and Tao Thao got 3 1/2 years. They were convicted in February of two counts of violating Floyd’s civil rights. The jury found they deprived the 46-year-old Black man of medical care and failed to stop Derek Chauvin as he knelt on Floyd’s neck for 9 1/2 minutes.",
            "As Chauvin pinned Floyd’s neck, Kueng held Floyd’s back, Officer Thomas Lane held his feet and Thao kept bystanders back during the killing, which was recorded by bystanders.",
            "The federal government brought the civil rights charges against all four officers in May 2021, a month after Chauvin was convicted of murder and manslaughter in state court. They were seen as an affirmation of the Justice Department’s priorities to address racial inequities in policing, a promise made by President Joe Biden before his election. And they came just a week after federal prosecutors brought hate crimes charges in the killing of 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia and announced two sweeping probes into policing in two states.",
            "Kueng and Thao were convicted in February of two counts of violating Floyd’s civil rights. The jury found they deprived the 46-year-old Black man of medical care and failed to stop Chauvin. Kueng, who is Black, was sentenced to three years on each count, to be served concurrently. Thao, who is Hmong American, was due to be sentenced later Wednesday.",
            "The lower sentence for Kueng and Thao raise questions about whether he would consider a plea deal or risk a state court trial on Oct. 24, when they face counts of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.",
            "Chauvin, who pleaded guilty last year to violating Floyd’s civil rights and the civil rights of a teenager in an unrelated case, was sentenced to 21 years in federal prison. Lane, who twice asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side so he could breathe, was convicted of one count and was sentenced last week to 2 1/2 — a sentence Floyd’s brother Philonise called “insulting.“",
            "Kueng and Thao got a victory last week when Magnuson issued rulings that affected how their federal sentences would be calculated. The rulings — particularly one that cross-references their crimes with involuntary manslaughter instead of murder — meant the men headed into Wednesday’s hearings with a recommended range of 4 1/4 years to 5 1/4 years. They might have faced a life sentence.",
            "Mark Osler, a professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law and former federal prosecutor, said ahead of the hearings that Kueng and Thao would likely seek a plea deal on the state charges that won’t exceed the federal sentence and will let them serve the sentences concurrently.",
            "Kueng and Thao can still appeal their federal convictions. If they plead guilty in state court, any federal appeal would be moot, said Mike Brandt, a criminal defense attorney who has been following the case. But it’s also hard to win a federal appeal, he said.",
            "“Those are some of the calculuses they are going to have to make in terms of, `Do I go to trial and risk something worse? Do I think I have a good shot at appeal on the federal case?’” Brandt said.",
            "Lane, who is white, pleaded guilty to a state charge of aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter and is awaiting sentencing in that case. He was allowed to remain free on bond after his federal sentencing.",
            "Chauvin, who is white, was sentenced to a 22 1/2-year state sentence in addition to his federal sentence. Those sentences are being served simultaneously.___Find AP’s full coverage of the killing of George Floyd at: https://apnews.com/hub/death-of-george-floyd"

            "Democratic legislation that would protect the right to birth control and other contraceptives was blocked by Senate Republicans on Wednesday, a little more than a month after the Supreme Court reversed nearly 50 years of precedent and overturned abortion rights.",
            "Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) objected to a request to pass the bill via unanimous consent. If any senator opposes such a request on the Senate floor, it is rejected.",
            "Ernst claimed the Democrats’ bill “purposefully goes far beyond the scope of contraception” and said it could fund abortion providers and protect abortion-inducing drugs.",
            "The House passed the Right to Contraception Act last week amid fears that the high court may come for reproductive health care next. Democrats pointed to an opinion from Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas suggesting the court should reexamine precedent that guaranteed the right to contraception.",
            "The legislation would create a statutory right for people to obtain and use contraceptives, as well as codifying protections for physicians who provide them.",
            "In the House, 195 Republicans opposed the measure.",
            "Ernst on Wednesday sought to pass her own bill that would expedite over-the-counter access to birth control. Democrats objected, saying it wouldn’t prevent states from restricting or even banning access to birth control.",
            "“Her bill would not ensure access to birth control, and it fails to codify the constitutional right to birth control across the United States,” Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) said.",
            "The right to buy and use contraceptives is currently protected by the 1965 landmark Supreme Court decision in Griswold v. Connecticut.",

            "As heat waves and record-setting temperatures make headlines around the world, people are doing what they can to stay cool. The situation is even more challenging for those with pets.",
            "Although we often associate dogs with outdoor play, many cats also enjoy spending time outside, and some even go for regular walks with their humans. But is it safe to take your feline friends out of the house in these conditions? And how can you ensure they remain healthy and happy when you do?",
            "Below, pet experts break down what you need to know about letting your cats out in the heat.",
            "Pay attention to rising temperatures“On hot days, heat stroke is a very serious concern in cats, not just dogs,” said cat behaviorist Mieshelle Nagelschneider, owner of the Cat Behavior Clinic. Once temperatures move into the 80s, it can be a problem for cats. Heat in the 90s and above poses even more serious risk. Not only should they not go outside in high heat, but inside the home, the air conditioner should be used. “Many owners leave for work and leave their cats in sweltering conditions, which can be dangerous,” Nagelschneider said.To determine if it’s too hot for your cat to go outside, take note of heat advisories and severe weather forecasts. Don’t just look at the temperature but the heat index, or real feel, as well.“From a welfare perspective, studies indicate that cats’ ‘thermoneutral zone’ ― the temperatures at which cats can regulate their body temperature with the least effort ― is 86 to 97 degrees,” said Annie Valuska, a senior pet behavior scientist at Purina. “Even if the temperature outside is lower than 97, owners should also keep in mind that other factors, such as the intensity of the sun and the humidity level, can contribute to it feeling warmer outside than the actual temperature.” Ensure they have water and shade",
            "“If your cat does go outside on a very hot day, make sure there is adequate water (ideally cold) available for them to drink and that a shady cool area is accessible for them to sit in,” said Dr. Michelle Meyer, president of the American Association of Feline Practitioners. “Keeping out of the sun and in the cooler shade can allow them to cool off. Cats can tolerate the heat a bit better than dogs ― they love to sit in the sunny spots while indoors ― but it’s important to note that they can suffer from overheating as well.”",
            "Try to let them out during cooler times of day, like early in the morning and in the evening. Give them plenty of fresh, clean water and use a bowl that isn’t metal, as that can get overheated in the scorching temperatures.",
            "“Do not allow pets to drink from standing water outside (in bird baths, puddles, creeks, old tires, etc.) as they can be exposed to life-threatening bacteria and parasites,” said Dr. LaCheryl Ball, a veterinarian with the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals’ community medicine team.",
            "You’ll also want to make sure your cat is able to get back inside easily in the event that they get too hot. Consider investing in a cooling mat where they can seek relief as well.",
            "“Outdoor cats may seek shelter in unlikely places in an attempt to stay cool, so carefully check for cats under cars before driving and in open sheds and garages before locking them up,” Valuska advised.",
            "Protect their paws",
            "“Walks aren’t just for dogs ― cats enjoy their strolls too,” said Twila McGee, CEO and founder of NOLAs Finest Pet Care.",
            "She recommended having a properly fitted harness for your cat’s walks so that you can keep them safe and supervised. Make sure their paws are protected as well.",
            "“Sidewalks and pavement can be extremely hot and cause burns to the paw pads,” said Dr. Emily Cross, a veterinarian at Purina. “It is best to have animals in the grass versus on hot surfaces. You can touch the sidewalk or pavement with your hand or bare foot. If it feels hot to you, it is too hot for them as well.”",
            "Some cats can wear little booties or socks, but your kitty might not tolerate them. You can also buy or make your own paw wax, which can offer some protection. Still, the best option is limiting their time outside in sweltering temperatures.",
            "“As pets are close to the ground, the hot asphalt can also contribute to their body heating up very quickly,” Ball said. “Pets with paw pad burns will limp, refuse to walk, and the top layer of skin will look like it’s blistering and peeling, or may even be absent. Hot asphalt can burn the sensitive paw pads on our pets. Always check for redness between toes and cracks on your pet’s paw pads.”",
            "Pay attention for signs of overheating",
            "“Just like dogs, a cat’s only means of cooling itself off is by panting and sweating through its paws,” Nagelschneider noted. “You never want to see your cat pant, even during a play time. You’ve overexerted your cat if you see this.”",
            "Indeed, panting is not typical behavior in cats, so if you observe this, you should immediately move them to an air-conditioned and shaded place and give them water. Contact your vet, especially if they show other signs of heat stroke, like vomiting, dizziness, lethargy, drooling or bright red gums. Look out for sweaty paw prints as well.",
            "“Have an action plan in place so you can act early if you see a problem,” Valuska said. “Get to know your cat’s normal behaviors during milder temperatures so that you’re better equipped to notice a change in behavior indicating they may not be coping well with heat. Cat behavior changes can be subtle, so close observation of your cat is key.”",
            "Consider your individual cat’s needs",
            "“Young cats and kittens and older cats are especially susceptible to heat stroke,” Nagelschneider said. “Overweight cats and breeds with shorter faces like Persians are at higher risk for heat stroke.”",
            "Certain breeds of cat are brachycephalic ― which means their skull bones are shorter, giving them that flat-faced appearance. These breeds, which include Persian, Himalayan, and Burmese cats, tend to have breathing issues and don’t pant as effectively, so you’ll want to pay extra-close attention to them in hot environments and keep them inside when possible.",
            "Don’t forget about sunscreen",
            "“Like humans, pets can also get sunburned, especially on noses, ears and any exposed skin,” Ball said. “This should be considered for any pet, but especially hairless cats.”",
            "Avoid putting sunscreen that was formulated for humans on your pets.",
            "“Check with your vet about recommendations for a cat-safe sunscreen for noses and ears, especially on cats with white fur,” Valuska advised.",
            "Ball also recommended antiparasitic products (like preventative sprays, drops, and oral medications) to ward off fleas, ticks and worms during the summer months.",
            "“Always be sure to read the labels before applying to your pet,” she said.",
            "Feed them hydrating meals",
            "“Cats don’t have a thirst drive like humans and dogs do, so they may need extra encouragement to stay hydrated,” Valuska said. “Consider supplementing their diet with wet food or liquid complements and making their water more attractive by investing in a ‘cat fountain’ and sanitizing their water bowl regularly.”",
            "In higher temperatures, food might spoil more quickly and attract bugs, so be sure to change it more often.",
            "“Owners can help encourage extra water intake ― which is especially important in older cats to prevent dehydration ― by making sure a good supply of fresh water is always available,” said Dr. Nathalie Dowgray, head of International Cat Care’s veterinary division, the International Society of Feline Medicine. “This includes multiple bowls in different locations around the home, away from food bowls and litter trays. Most cats prefer wide and shallow bowls filled to the brim.”",
            "Dowgray also recommended adding flavor to their water with the liquid left over from a can of tuna in spring water or from poaching a piece of chicken or fish.",
            "“In hot weather, cats often won’t eat during the day but will eat at night or in the early morning when it’s cooler, so you might need to adjust your feeding times to suit your cat’s preferences,” Dowgray added.",
            "Don’t shave them",
            "“Please, do not shave your cat!” urged Linda Hall and Rita Reimers, co-founders of the Cat Behavior Alliance. “Many people think it will make the cat cooler, but that fur protects them. The only time we suggest shaving is in case of bad matting where you have no choice.”",
            "If you have a shaved cat, refrain from taking them out in the sun, as their skin is fragile and susceptible to sunburn.",
            "“Fur protects skin from heat and sunburn, so consider a trim instead,” McGee advised. “Consult with your groomer about summer cuts.”",
            "Regular grooming practices like brushing can also remove shedding hair and help your cat feel more cool and comfortable.",
            "“For pet parents that have cats with beautiful long fur such as Maine coons and Norwegian forests, make sure to brush daily,” McGee added."

            "The British actor appeared on “The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon” for the first time Monday to reveal he was detained at immigration on his arrival in the U.S. a day earlier.",
            "Fortunately for Quinn, his “Stranger Things” character of Eddie Munson is universally adored — even by customs officials.",
            "“I was taken into, I guess what you could call it, was more of a dungeon,” Quinn told the host. “And I was asked to wait there for about 20 minutes and then I was summoned to this desk where someone asked me, ‘What are you doing in the United States, Sir?’”",
            "While fans love Quinn’s portrayal of metalhead slacker Eddie Munson, the character was only introduced in the fourth season and may be hard to identify without his torn jeans and long trademark hair.",
            "“Well I’m actually here to meet Jimmy Fallon on ‘The Tonight Show,’” Quinn said he replied. “And he didn’t believe me. And one of his colleagues looked over at me, looked at him, and said: ‘Leave Eddie alone.’”",
            "The first agent, realizing who he’d been interrogating, then asked Quinn the one question “Stranger Things” fans have been clamoring for: “Do you come back next season?”",
            "Quinn himself claimed to have no idea whether Munson would return and said he told the agent as much. He was ultimately given a stern warning before having his passport returned: “You better.”",
            "In his conversation with Fallon, Quinn expounded further on the beauty of the “Stranger Things” fandom. He said he was moved by how strongly fans at Comic-Con identify with his character.",
            "“I think it’s probably the fact that he’s an outsider, a little bit kind of on the fringes of society,” said Quinn. “It’s so moving to see how much he means to people.”",
            "Quinn read one of Munson’s monologues, switching accents from Scotland, Liverpool, Australia, New York City and Wales from one line to the next.",
            "Fallon reminded Quinn that his rendition of Metallica’s “Master of Puppets” during a vital “Stranger Things” scene landed the song on the Billboard charts for the first time in decades. Quinn joked that he didn’t share any royalties, but did get a shoutout from his acting idol Jack Black.",
            "Quinn told Fallon he has “worshipped” Black since “School of Rock” was released in 2003. A heavy metal fan himself, Black spoke on the red carpet for “Kung Fu Panda: The Dragon Knight” about binge-watching “Stranger Things” with his son — and falling for Eddie Munson.",
            "“It was pretty epic,” said Black. “I was geeking out pretty hard. And then I was like, ‘Why did you kill the heavy metal guy? He was the best character!’”"

            "Dozens of incoming medical students at the University of Michigan Medical School walked out of their own induction ceremony Sunday in protest of the event’s keynote speaker, Dr. Kristin Collier — a Michigan faculty member and primary care physician who has publicly voiced her opposition to abortion rights.",
            "A video shot by Detroit resident Brendan Scorpio shows students who’d just received their white coats in the school’s annual White Coat Ceremony walking out of the auditorium as Collier begins her address. A number of other attendees join them.",
            "“The overall message that the students wanted to push was that reproductive rights, abortion, is health care,” Scorpio, who was there to support an incoming student, told NPR. “Reproductive rights for anyone who is able to give birth are incredibly important and should be something that’s allowed to everyone in the country.”",
            "Scorpio estimated that roughly 70 of the 170 incoming students walked out, followed by some friends and family “in solidarity.” Collier, a graduate of the U-M Medical School, reportedly did not make explicit reference to abortion in her remarks at the ceremony.",
            "Last month, Collier told the Catholic newsletter The Pillar that she and other like-minded health care providers advocate for the “expansion of rights for some of the most vulnerable members of the human family,” referring to fetuses.",
            "“There is no more beautiful testament to the growth of society when it extends rights to a vulnerable population that did not have them before,” Collier said in the interview, which was published the same day the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.",
            "She has also tweeted her views against abortion rights, writing in May: “I can’t not lament the violence directed at my prenatal sisters in the act of abortion, done in the name of autonomy.”",
            "Prior to the ceremony, a group of students petitioned to have Collier replaced as the keynote speaker, CNN reports.",
            "“While we support the rights of freedom of speech and religion, an anti-choice speaker as a representative of the University of Michigan undermines the University’s position on abortion and supports the non-universal, theology-rooted platform to restrict abortion access, an essential part of medical care,” the petition reads in part.",
            "Elliott Brannon, a medical student who was involved in organizing the petition, told CNN that more than 300 medical students signed it. The medical school currently has 785 students enrolled, according to its website.",

However, the University of Michigan does not revoke an invitation to a speaker based on their personal beliefs.”",
            "The university said in its statement that it remains “committed to providing high quality, safe reproductive care for patients, across all their reproductive health needs,” including abortion care."

            "ATLANTA (AP) — A judge in Atlanta has rejected an appeal by a group of voters and affirmed the Georgia secretary of state’s decision that U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is eligible to run for reelection.",
            "The five voters from Greene’s district sought to have her removed from the ballot, saying that she played a significant role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol that disrupted Congress’ certification of Biden’s presidential victory. That was a violation of a rarely invoked provision in the 14th Amendment against insurrection or rebellion, they argued.",
            "Represented by Free Speech for People, a national election and campaign finance reform group, the voters filed a complaint with Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in March.",
            "Greene was questioned extensively during a daylong hearing in April before Georgia Administrative Law Judge Charles Beaudrot, who ruled on May 6 that Greene should not be disqualified. Raffensperger immediately affirmed the decision.",

            "The voters said Beaudrot made four legal errors, but Brasher found that Beaudrot acted properly.",
            "Free Speech for People said in a statement that Brasher ruled “with minimal legal analysis,” and that it has not decided whether to appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court.",
            "The challenge to Greene’s eligibility was based on a section of the 14th Amendment that says no one can serve in Congress “who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress ... to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same.”",
            "Ratified shortly after the Civil War, it was meant in part to keep representatives who had fought for the Confederacy from returning to Congress.",

            "Robinson, who died in 1972, had an impact beyond baseball, galvanizing a significant slice of American public opinion and boosting the civil rights movement.",
            "“There’s nowhere on the globe where dream is attached to our name — or our country’s name,” New York City Mayor Eric Adams said. “There’s not a German dream. There’s not a French dream. There’s not a Polish dream. Darn it, there’s an American dream. And this man and wife took that dream and forced America and baseball to say you’re not going to be a dream on a piece of paper, you’re going to be a dream in life. We are greater because of No. 42 and because he had amazing wife that understood that dream and vision.”",
            "A gala dinner was held Monday night to preview the museum, which contains 350 artifacts, including playing equipment and items such as Robinson’s 1946 minor league contract for $600 a month and his 1947 rookie contract for a $5,000 salary. The museum also holds a collection of 40,000 images and 450 hours of footage.",
            "A 15-piece band played at the ceremony, attended by former pitcher CC Sabathia, former NL president Len Coleman and former Mets owner Fred Wilpon along with players’ association head Tony Clark and Hall of Fame president Josh Rawitch.",
            "“Without him, there would be no me,” Sabathia said. “I wouldn’t have been able to live out my dream of playing Major League Baseball.”",
            "Yankees general manager Brian Cashman, director Spike Lee (wearing a Brooklyn Dodgers cap) and former tennis star Billie Jean King also were on hand.",
            "“It seems like we’re more divided than ever,” King said. “People like Jackie Robinson was a great reminder every single morning, every single evening that we have to do the right thing every day.”",
            "Original projections had a 2010 opening and $25 million cost. The Great Recession caused a delay.",
            "Ground finally was broken on April 27, 2017, when the Jackie Robinson Foundation said it had raised $23.5 million of a planned $42 million and the museum was intended to open in 2019. The pandemic caused more delays, and the total raised has risen to $38 million, of which $2.6 million was contributed by New York City.",
            "Tickets will cost $18 for adults and $15 for students, seniors and children when the museum opens to the public on Sept. 5. The second floor includes an education center, part of a plan envisioned by Rachel Robinson.",
            "“She wanted a fixed tribute to her husband, where people could come and learn about him, but also be inspired,” said foundation president Della Britton, who headed the project. “We want to be that place, as young people now say, a safe space, where people will talk about race and not worry about the initial backlash that happens when you say something on social media.”",
            "David Robinson said his father would have been proud.",
            "“He was a man who used the word ‘we,’” David said. “I think today Jackie Robinson would say I accept this honor, but I accept this honor on behalf of something far beyond my individual self, far beyond my family, far beyond even my race. Jackie Robinson would say don’t think of you standing on my shoulders, I think of myself as standing on the shoulders of my mother, who was a sharecropper in Georgia, my grandmother, who was born a slave.”",

            "Fresh from a double contempt of Congress conviction linked to his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, Steve Bannon is now calling on “4,000 shock troops” to “deconstruct” the federal government “brick by brick.”",
            "He wants to see people “stepping forward, say[ing], ’Hey, I want to be one of those 4,000 shock troops,” Bannon said on his “War Room” podcast Monday. “This is taking on and defeating and deconstructing the administrative state,” he added.",
            "“Shock troops” are assault forces that lead an attack.",
            "“Suck on it,” said Bannon. “We’re destroying this illegitimate regime.”",
            "Bannon’s incendiary comments evoked his ominous call the day before the U.S. Capitol riot, when he told supporters of then-President Donald Trump on his podcast: “All hell is going to break loose tomorrow. We’re on ... the point of attack ... strap in.”",
            "Bannon was responding to an Axios report last week that Trump and his allies are already plotting to replace all federal officials and civil service workers with those whose key qualification would be slavish devotion to Trump if he retakes the White House in the 2024 election.",
            "Bannon hailed the radical plot for Trump to take control of the nation. Former Trump campaign adviser Steve Cortes vowed on the podcast that Trump’s “next” term would be “far more consequential” than his last one. Both men were clearly familiar with the game plan.",
            "Bannon had also called for “shock troops” to “immediately” seize control of the nation a month before the 2020 election, when he expected Trump to win reelection — or seize control of the vote results. “Pre-trained teams” need to be “ready to jump into federal agencies,” Bannon told NBC News then.",
            "Bloomberg opinion columnist Jonathan Bernstein wrote Monday that “contempt for the rule of law” appeared to be a key qualification for workers in Trump’s future world in office, to fulfill his aim to “blow up the Constitution.”",
            "Bannon was convicted Friday of two counts of contempt of Congress for blowing off a subpoena to provide documents and be interviewed by members of the House select committee about his activities linked to the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol — including plotting with Trump to overthrow presidential election results.",
            "Bannon vowed to “go medieval” on his enemies when he was served with his subpoena last year and said he would make the charges against him the “misdemeanor from hell” for the Biden administration. Instead, he didn’t even take the stand in his defense. The jury determined he was guilty after deliberating less than three hours."

            "Paul Sorvino, an imposing actor who specialized in playing crooks and cops like Paulie Cicero in “Goodfellas” and the NYPD sergeant Phil Cerretta on “Law & Order,” has died. He was 83.",
            "His publicist Roger Neal said he died Monday morning of natural causes at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida. Sorvino had dealt with health issues over the past few years.",
            "“Our hearts are broken, there will never be another Paul Sorvino, he was the love of my life, and one of the greatest performers to ever grace the screen and stage,” his wife, Dee Dee Sorvino, said in a statement. She was by his side when he died.",
            "In his over 50 years in the entertainment business, Sorvino was a mainstay in films and television, playing an Italian American communist in Warren Beatty’s “Reds,” Henry Kissinger in Oliver Stone’s “Nixon” and mob boss Eddie Valentine in “The Rocketeer.” He would often say that while he might be best known for playing gangsters, his real passions were poetry, painting and opera.",
            "Born in Brooklyn in 1939 to a mother who taught piano and father who was a foreman in a robe factory, Sorvino was musically inclined from a young age and attended the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in New York where he fell for the theater. He made his Broadway debut in 1964 in “Bajour” and his film debut in Carl Reiner’s “Where’s Poppa?” in 1970.",
            "With his 6-foot-4-inch stature, Sorvino made an impactful presence no matter the medium. In the 1970s, he acted alongside Al Pacino in “The Panic in Needle Park” and with James Caan in “The Gambler,” reteamed with Reiner in “Oh, God!” and was among the ensemble in William Friedkin’s bank robbery comedy “The Brink’s Job.” In John G. Avildsen’s “Rocky” follow-up “Slow Dancing in the Big City,” Sorvino got to play a romantic lead and use his dance training opposite professional ballerina Anne Ditchburn.",
            "He was especially prolific in the 1990s, kicking off the decade playing Lips in Beatty’s “Dick Tracy” and Paul Cicero in Martin Scorsese’s “Goodfellas,” who was based on the real-life mobster Paul Vario, and 31 episodes on Dick Wolf’s “Law & Order.”",
            "He followed those with roles in “The Rocketeer,” “The Firm,” “Nixon,” which got him a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination, and Baz Luhrmann’s “Romeo + Juliet” as Juliet’s father, Fulgencio Capulet.",
            "Beatty would turn to Sorvino often, enlisting him again for his political satire “Bulworth,” which came out in 1998, and his 2016 Hollywood love letter “Rules Don’t Apply.” He also appeared in James Gray’s “The Immigrant.”",
            "Sorvino had three children from his first marriage, including Academy Award-winning actor Mira Sorvino. He also directed and starred in a film written by his daughter Amanda Sorvino and featuring his son Michael Sorvino.",
            "When he learned that Mira Sorvino had been among the women allegedly sexually harassed and blacklisted by Harvey Weinstein in the midst of the #MeToo reckoning, he told TMZ that if he had known, Weinstein, “Would not be walking. He’d be in a wheelchair.”",
            "He was proud of his daughter and cried when she won the best supporting actress Oscar for “Mighty Aphrodite” in 1996. He the Los Angeles Times that night that he didn’t have the words to express how he felt.",
            "“They don’t exist in any language that I’ve ever heard — well, maybe Italian,” he said.",
            "But he wanted to be seen for more than what he was on screen and took particular pride in his singing. In 1996, “Paul Sorvino: An Evening of Song” was broadcast on television as a part of a PBS fundraising campaign. Songs performed included “Torna A Sorriento,” “Guaglione,” “O Sole Mio,” “The Impossible Dream” and “Mama.”",
            "“I’m a pop singer in the sense Mario Lanza was,” Sorvino said in an interview the Tampa Tribune. “It astonishes me that no American male singer sings with a full voice anymore. Where have all the tenors gone?”",
            "The weight of his voice, he thought, made it difficult to train.",
            "“It’s like trying to park a bus in a VW parking space,” he said.",
            "He also ran a horse rescue in Pennsylvania, had a grocery store pasta sauce line based on his mother’s recipe, and sculpted a bronze statue of the late playwright Jason Miller that resides in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Sorvino had starred in Miller’s Tony and Pulitzer-winning play “That Championship Season” on Broadway in 1972 and its film adaptation.",
            "In 2014, he married political pundit Dee Dee Benkie and said that a goal of his later life was to “disabuse people of the notion that I’m a slow-moving, heavy-lidded thug.”",
            "As with most who starred in “Goodfellas,” the image would follow him for the rest of his life which he had complex feelings about.",
            "’Most people think I’m either a gangster or a cop or something,” he said. “The reality is I’m a sculptor, a painter, a best-selling author, many, many things — a poet, an opera singer, but none of them is gangster.... It would be nice to have my legacy more than that of just tough guy.”"

            "“If she is to survive, she will live only a matter of hours after birth. During that time, she will experience a multitude of seizures and ultimately aspirate on her own bodily fluids.

            "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden continues to “improve significantly” despite a lingering sore throat from his coronavirus infection, according to an update Sunday from his doctor.",
            "“The president is responding to therapy as expected,” wrote Dr. Kevin O’Connor in his latest note. Biden has been taking Paxlovid, an antiviral drug that helps reduce the chance of severe illness.",
            "O’Connor wrote that Biden still has a sore throat, though other symptoms, including a cough, runny nose and body aches, “have diminished considerably.”",
            "Biden tested positive for the coronavirus on Thursday morning. O’Connor said Saturday that the president likely became infected with a highly contagious variant, known as BA.5, that is spreading throughout the country, and Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House COVID-19 response coordinator, said Sunday, “It is the BA.5 variant.”",
            "“Thank goodness our vaccines and therapeutics work well against it, which is why I think the president’s doing well,” Jha told CBS’ “Face the Nation.”",
            "Jha also gave a positive update on the president’s health.",
            "“I checked in with his team late last night. He was feeling well. He had a good day yesterday,” Jha said.",
            "That variant is an offshoot of the omicron strain that emerged late last year. It is believed responsible for the vast majority of coronavirus cases in the country. He has been isolating in the White House residence since then.",
            "Administration officials have emphasized that his symptoms are mild because he has received four vaccine doses, and he started taking the antiviral drug Paxlovid after becoming infected.",
            "The White House has not released any photos or video of Biden since Friday, when the media watched him participate in a virtual meeting with economic advisers.",
            "Jha pledged that the White House would keep giving updates on the president’s condition and whether he might have long-term symptoms.",

But I suspect that this is going to be a course of COVID that we’ve seen in many Americans who have ben fully vaccinated, double boosted, getting treated with those tools in hand,” Jha said. “The president’s been doing well and we’re going to expect that he’s going to continue to do so.’’",
            "Biden’s press secretary has said 17 people, including members of the president’s senior staff and at least one member of Congress, were determined to have been in close contact with Biden when he might have been contagious.

            "Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones will face a jury of his peers for the first time next week in a defamation trial to determine how much he will have to pay the parents of a child killed in a school shooting after he spent years peddling lies that the tragic ordeal never happened.",
            "On Dec. 14, 2012, a gunman walked into Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, and opened fire. He killed 20 children and six adults in a shooting that former President Barack Obama would later call the worst day of his presidency.",
            "As the families of the dead mourned, the carnival-barker host of the conspiracy and disinformation outlet Infowars was working on his next big grift: convincing his listeners that the 6- and 7-year-old children who were killed, along with the adults who died trying to protect them, were part of an elaborate hoax.",
            "It would mark the beginning of Jones’ many legal troubles to come.",
            "From Lies To Real-World Threats",
            "“Folks, we’ve got video of Anderson Cooper with clear blue-screen out there,” Jones said in a 2014 Infowars segment about the CNN anchor interviewing victims of the tragedy two years later.“He’s not there in the town square,” Jones continued. “We got people clearly coming up and laughing and then doing the fake crying. We’ve clearly got people where it’s actors playing different parts for different people, the building bulldozed, covering up everything.”In 2016, Jones repeated the lie that the parents of dead kids were acting.“I’ve watched a lot of soap operas, and I’ve seen actors before. And I know when I’m watching a movie and when I’m watching something real,” Jones said on his program.The following year, Jones was still spreading the lie that the shooting was faked. “So here are these holier than thou people, when we question CNN, who is supposedly at the site of Sandy Hook, and they got in one shot leaves blowing, and the flowers that are around it, and you see the leaves blowing, and they go [gestures]. They glitch,” Jones said, according to a transcript quoted in a lawsuit against him and reviewed by HuffPost. “They’re recycling a green-screen behind them.”Jones’ dangerous lies had real-life consequences for victims of the shooting. In 2017, Florida woman Lucy Richards was sentenced to five months in prison for sending threats to parent Lenny Pozner, whose 6-year-old son, Noah, was killed in the shooting.“You gonna die,” Richards told Pozner in one recorded voicemail message. “Death is coming to you real soon.”As part of her sentence, Richards was ordered not to access Infowars.The Families Fight BackIn 2018, parents of two children killed in the shooting filed the first defamation suits against Jones and Infowars, HuffPost was the first to report at the time. Neil Heslin, the father of 6-year-old Jesse, along with 6-year-old Noah’s parents, Pozner and Veronique De La Rosa, alleged that Jones’ lies had led to death threats.“I lost my son. I buried my son. I held my son with a bullet hole through his head,” Heslin told then-NBC News host Megyn Kelly in a June 2017 segment profiling Jones. With the new lawsuit, Heslin finally had the chance to hold Jones accountable.“Even after these folks had to experience this trauma, for the next five years they were tormented by Alex Jones with vicious lies about them,” attorney Mark Bankston of Houston law firm Farrar & Ball told HuffPost in 2018. “And these lies were meant to convince his audience that the Sandy Hook parents are frauds and have perpetrated a sinister lie on the American people.”",
            "Later that year, six Sandy Hook families and an FBI agent filed their own defamation lawsuit against Jones in Connecticut. Josh Koskoff of the Bridgeport, Connecticut-based law firm Koskoff Koskoff & Bieder, told HuffPost at the time that the lawsuit would seek to hold Jones and “his financial network accountable.”",
            "“He knew his claims were false but he made them anyway to further a simple but pathetic goal: to make money by tearing away at the families’ pain,” Koskoff told HuffPost at the time. “This lawsuit seeks to hold Alex Jones and his financial network accountable for those disgraceful actions.”",
            "Alex Jones Loses Every Single Case",
            "For the next several years, Jones repeatedly failed in court as he attempted to avoid accountability.",
            "Jones cycled through lawyers as if they had an expiration date, but managed to retain attorney Norm Pattis, who most recently was seen at a comedy club with his pants down and saying the N-word during a stand-up set.",
            "In a 2019 deposition about one of his several defamation lawsuits, Jones was unable to recall basic facts about the school shooting, including the date that it happened.",
            "“I talk four hours a day, and I can’t remember what I talked about sometimes a week ago,” Jones said at the time.",
            "Infowars editor Paul Joseph Watson threw his boss under the bus in his own deposition when he admitted to warning Jones about the dangers of spreading lies about Sandy Hook, only to be ignored.",
            "Ultimately, it was Jones’ refusal to provide court-ordered documents that led to his already shaky defense crumbling. In September, Jones lost two of his Sandy Hook defamation cases after Texas Judge Maya Guerra Gamble ruled for default judgments against Jones for not turning over documents. The ruling meant he and Infowars were found liable for all damages.",
            "Later that same week, Gamble again ruled default judgment against Jones in the defamation case brought forward by Sandy Hook parent Heslin, adding to Jones’ third legal loss. And finally, just over a month after Gamble’s ruling, Connecticut Judge Barbara Bellis also ruled default judgment against Jones in the case brought forward by several Sandy Hook families.",
            "Jones had lost his cases before they could see a jury. Now it was time to pay up.",
            "Paying Up",
            "Following the rulings against Jones, the Infowars host attempted to wriggle out of his responsibility to the parents of Sandy Hook by declaring bankruptcy just days before he was set to be put on trial in Austin, Texas, in April for one of his defamation cases.",
            "The bankruptcy ploy worked in delaying the trial, but the law has once again caught up to Jones.",
            "On Monday, a jury in Austin will be selected to determine how much Jones and Infowars will ultimately have to pay to parents Heslin and Scarlett Lewis, Jesse’s mother, for the pain he inflicted on them for more than half a decade after the death of their child.",
            "Opening arguments start Tuesday at Travis County Court, and the trial will be open to the public.",
            "The jury will look at two factors: How much Jones should pay for damages, and how much additional money he should pay based on his net worth. Jones has closely guarded his financial earnings for years, but there are clues that give a glimpse into how much his empire is worth.",
            "For instance, HuffPost reported in January that the Infowars store ― which sells a hodgepodge of dietary supplements and survival gear ― sold $165 million in product from September 2015 to the end of 2018, according to court filings related to one of the defamation lawsuits Jones recently lost.",
            "And in May, the SPLC reported that Jones had received nearly $8 million in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin from an anonymous donor.",
            "Bankston, the attorney representing Heslin and Lewis, told HuffPost an expert witness will be called to testify about Jones’ finances.",
            "Whatever Jones ends up having to pay, it won’t be the end of his financial bleeding. He’ll be back in a courtroom in September, this time in Connecticut, where a jury will determine how much he should pay to Sandy Hook families in a separate defamation lawsuit.",
            "Bankston said that despite a decade of “tormenting” the Sandy Hook parents, Jones will soon face justice.",
            "“After ten years of tormenting these parents, and after four years of trying to sabotage their lawsuit, Mr. Jones will finally face the long-awaited public reckoning for committing the most vile and despicable campaign of slander in American history,” Bankston told HuffPost in a statement. “We are eager to show this jury the previously hidden details of Mr. Jones’ monstrous acts of revenge against the parents who begged him to stop peddling his lies.”",
            "Heslin is determined to get justice in court ― not just monetary compensation for the pain Jones inflicted on his family. Others seem to agree: Every Sandy Hook victim involved in the Connecticut lawsuit rejected Jones’ attempts to avoid a jury when he tried in March to settle the lawsuit by offering $120,000 per plaintiff.",
            "“With me it was never about money – it was about principle,” Heslin told the News-Times in Connecticut at the time. “I’m not surprised Jones would try to settle before this goes to trial, but I am going to trial to fight him. I am going to argue the whole thing.”"

            "Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley’s ignominious dash for cover in the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 — after giving a closed-fist salute to insurrectionists — has made him a national “laughingstock,” The Kansas City Star said in a derisive editorial Saturday.",
            "A video of the Missouri native’s sprint to dodge the mob that day was played during televised hearings Thursday of the House Jan. 6 committee. The Missouri newspaper said the clip exposed Hawley, who’s since been widely ridiculed, for the “fleeing coward” he is.",
            "Though, the Star pointed out, humiliation fails to yield change or apology from the cohort of GOP politicians to which Hawley belongs.",
            "“Shame, clearly, is not a motivating factor for any number of Republicans still caught up in Trumpworld,” the Star pointed out.",
            "The publication noted Hawley never apologized for trying to secure a second Donald Trump presidency despite Joe Biden’s proven victory.",
            "“Watching Hawley racing away from the Capitol invaders struck so many people as blackly hilarious,” the Star added. “Saluting the Trump posse was politically expeditious for him before the siege began.",
            "“Where’s that fist in the air now?” the publication asked.",
            "The St. Louis Post-Dispatch was just as damning in its own Friday editorial, saying Hawley’s run “encapsulated his core cowardice” and “demonstrated beyond any doubt that Hawley understood, in real time, the physical danger he helped uncork that day.”",

            "A 9-year-old boy who was camping at an Iowa state park with his parents and 6-year-old sister survived a shooting that killed the rest of his family.",
            "The Iowa Department of Public Safety identified the victims as Tyler Schmidt, 42; his 42-year-old wife, Sarah Schmidt; and their 6-year-old daughter, Lula Schmidt, all of Cedar Falls, Iowa. Their bodies were found in their tent early Friday at the Maquoketa Caves State Park Campground, about 180 miles (290 kilometers) east of Des Moines.",
            "Authorities said the suspected gunman, 23-year-old Anthony Sherwin, was found dead Friday in a wooded area of the park with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.",
            "Mitch Mortvedt, assistant director of the Department of Public Safety’s division of criminal investigation, told The Associated Press on Saturday that the motive for the attack was still unknown.",
            "“We don’t know what led up to this, what precipitated it,” he said, adding that so far, “the investigation has not revealed any early interaction between the Schmidt family and him.”",
            "Adam Morehouse, Sarah Schmidt’s brother, said the family had no connection to Sherwin and he believed it was a “completely random act.”",
            "Cedar Falls Mayor Rob Green, who said he is a neighbor of the Schmidts, posted on Facebook on Friday that the couple’s 9-year-old son, Arlo, “survived the attack, and is safe.” The post did not say whether Arlo was in the tent or even at the campsite when the shootings happened, and the mayor told the AP he didn’t have those details.",
            "Morehouse confirmed Arlo was on the family’s camping trip, but said he did not know exactly where the boy was at the time of the shooting or know specifics about how it unfolded.",
            "“He is with family and he is OK, but I have not had any interaction with him,” Morehouse said Saturday. “As far as I know, he was uninjured physically.”",
            "By Saturday evening, more than $75,000 had flowed into a GoFundMe page created for Arlo. The page, organized by a cousin, Beth Shapiro, said: “Arlo is a strong boy, surrounded by family and friends who are supporting him as best we can.” The page says the fund will help Arlo now, and help fund his future education.",
            "The killings prompted the evacuation of the park and campground, including a children’s summer camp. After the evacuations, Sherwin was the only person unaccounted for, Mortvedt said.",
            "He said that during the course of the investigation, authorities learned Sherwin was armed and “that of course heightened our awareness.” Iowa allows people with permits to carry firearms virtually anywhere in the state. Officials did not say if Sherwin had a permit and provided no information about the firearm used to kill the Schmidts.",
            "The Des Moines Register reported that Sherwin was from La Vista, Nebraska. La Vista Police Chief Bob Lausten told the newspaper that Sherwin lived in an apartment complex with his parents and had no history of criminal conduct.",
            "Felicia Coe, 35, of Des Moines, was at the campground Friday morning with her boyfriend and his two sons, ages 11 and 16. She said the 16-year-old went out early to go running, and she was talking with someone at the park at about 6:30 a.m. when two park rangers dressed in helmets, vests and carrying what looked like automatic rifles told them to leave the campground.",
            "More law enforcement and an ambulance showed up as Coe went to find her boyfriend’s teenage son.",
            "At the time, Coe did not know what happened. But she recalls seeing a little boy standing near the paramedics.",
            "“He was in his pajamas. I distinctly remember he had one blue tennis shoe,” she said. She later saw a picture of the Schmidt family online and said she recognized the boy she saw as Arlo.",
            "“He’s got this really cute, floppy-curly, moppy, strawberry-blond hair that’s really distinguishable,” Coe said. “He was in these super cute little pajamas, like a cotton T-shirt and shorts that matched. ... He was just standing there. He wasn’t crying. He wasn’t distraught. But he also wasn’t being comforted. He was just standing there by himself.”",
            "She said the campers got little information about what happened and she began piecing it together on the drive home.",
            "“It’s hard to be so grateful that it wasn’t your family, when you know that another family, is just being ripped apart — multiple families,” she said.",
            "Green, the Cedar Falls mayor, said Sarah Schmidt worked at the city’s Public Library, which was closed Saturday.",
            "“Like many of you just hearing the news, I’m devastated,” Green wrote on Facebook. “I knew Sarah well, and she & her family were regular walkers here in the Sartori Park neighborhood. I was working with her this week on a public library tech presentation for 7/26.”",
            "Morehouse said Tyler Schmidt’s parents live in the Cedar Falls area, and Sarah Schmidt’s family members are scattered around the country, but were heading to Iowa. He said Tyler and Sarah lived in Lawrence, Kansas, for a time, where Sarah worked at the University of Kansas. Tyler was an IT software engineer. At one point, he said, Sarah worked on a project about monarch butterflies, and the couple were huge Kansas Jayhawks fans.",
            "In 2018, the Schmidts moved to Cedar Falls and had been active in the community ever since, Morehouse said. He said they loved the outdoors, and just got four pairs of snowshoes for Christmas.",
            "“The best way to describe all four of them was the quintessential Midwestern family. They gave everybody everything they possibly could. They loved family ... They enjoyed the outdoors, enjoyed the hiking — and this is just a question mark of ‘Why that campground and that campsite on that night?’”",

            "When your headliner angrily walks offstage before the show is over, the crowd might be the problem.",
            "That seemed to be the case at the Rolling Loud music festival Friday in Miami, Florida. Rapper Kid Cudi found himself bombarded by items thrown onstage by audience members and walked off in the middle of his set after warning them to stop, according to Variety.",
            "“Yo, I will walk off this stage if you all throw one more fucking thing up here, I will leave, I will leave right now,” said Cudi. “Throw one more fucking thing on this stage and I’ll walk off, I’m not fucking playing. I’m not fucking playing, you will ruin it for everybody.”",
            "“I’ll fucking leave if I get hit with one more fucking thing, if I see one more fucking thing on this fucking stage, I’m leaving. Don’t fuck with me,” he said.",
            "At least one audience member decided to double down, however, and launched a water bottle toward Cudi after he threatened to leave. The rapper subsequently dropped his microphone and walked offstage to both the cheers and chagrin of a polarized crowd, according to Rolling Stone.",
            "The incident went viral after the person who threw that final water bottle posted footage of the act on Twitter.",
            "Cudi was picked to replace Kanye West as a headliner for the festival after the “Donda 2” rapper pulled out less than a week before the show — only for him to make an appearance.",
            "“We spent months working with him and his team on the performance,” Rolling Loud co-founders Tariq Cherif and Matt Zingler said in a statement at the time.",
            "“Unfortunately, Ye has decided that he will no longer be performing,” their statement continued. This is the first time a headliner has ever pulled off our show and though we don’t take it lightly, we wish him the best.”",
            "West, who legally changed his name to Ye, emerged wearing a mask covering his entire face during rapper Lil Durk’s set.",
            "While it remains unclear whether West did so deliberately to spite Cudi, he partially performed “Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 1” from his “Life of Pablo” album, which contains predominant vocals from Cudi.",
            "The two rappers, who were once close friends and longtime collaborators, had a recent spat on social media. West was upset that Cudi was friends with former “Saturday Night Live” star Pete Davidson, who is dating his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian.",
            "“Just so everyone knows Cudi will not be on Donda because he’s friends with you know who,” wrote West in a since-deleted Instagram post.",
            "Cudi ultimately brushed this off by calling West a “dinosaur” in the comments of his post. He also tweeted that he didn’t mind being cast out of his circle because “God opens the door so the wrong people can exit ur life.”"

            "I loved all the religions I knew about as a young child. From the sweet-faced Jesus my great-grandparents talked about to the stern big daddy God of my Pentecostal cousins to the muddy femme spell-craft of my Appalachian kin, it didn’t seem strange to believe in it all. Then life happened. I learned you had to pick a god or at least a side.",
            "But I couldn’t see myself on one spiritual path. All of them seemed to revere the binary. Some paths were more equal than others for women. Most seemed ruled by men, with no possibility of genderlessness or ambiguity in any religious space. As a female-assigned person who was dubious about gender from a young age, I knew that I did not belong.",
            "I am not the only queer person who has struggled to find their place in a spiritual community. Sadly, I consider myself lucky because I did not experience religious trauma or the long-term emotional damage caused by practices like exclusion, or conversion therapy. For me, not fitting into religion was disappointing but not dangerous. Unfortunately, that is not true for many queer people.",
            "While many people find comfort and community in religion, queer people often face rejection and denigration that take a major toll on our well-being. Recent research suggests that religious trauma increases the risk of abuse, mental illness and suicidality for queer people. But it is human to crave a spiritual home, and more and more queer people are forging new spiritual paths instead of waiting for the old dogs of religion to learn new tricks. What contemporary queer spiritual leaders are doing is revolutionary as they rehabilitate our relationship with old religious ideas and structures.",
            "“I left mainstream Christianity because as an Asian American, bisexual woman, I intimately know what it feels like to have my body scrutinized and vilified as a sin,” Tara Teng, a spiritual embodiment coach in Vancouver, Canada, tells me. Teng helps people heal from trauma using their bodies. But she was formerly a preacher in the evangelical Southern Baptist tradition, as was her father. Ultimately, she was called to a different path because the intersections of her identity were not accepted. “There was an expectation to live up to my parents’ dreams for me, and being a bisexual Christian or ex-evangelical was not part of that,” Teng says.Now a leader in the Deconstructing Faith movement — a loosely organized group of spiritual orphans — she uses her work as an embodiment coach to help people reconnect to spirituality and their bodies after religious trauma. “When we know in our bodies that we, as queer people, are a unique embodiment of the Divine, then we can see how we have been lied to by institutions seeking to gatekeep access to God,” Teng says. “It does not have to be this way, and we can heal the trauma in our nervous systems that have been taught to believe such lies.”",
            "Our queer bodies are divine in and of themselves, says Teng, while also being a site of spiritual connection. We don’t need to be healed of our queerness, but we do need help recovering from religious teachings that tell us otherwise. Teng believes that a queer theology — ideas about God, religion and spirituality designed by and for queer people — can help us heal.",
            "“Healing comes when we welcome back the parts of ourselves that we severed due to trauma and anti-gay theology,” Teng says. “The key to my work is coming back into a relationship with our bodies. And for those who want to stay connected to their spirituality, recognizing that we, as queer people, are also made in the image of God.”",
            "She sees her beliefs not as contrary to the Christian faith but as reinterpretations of Scripture. “God is described in the Bible using gender-fluid imagery that includes both masculine and feminine energy — i.e., God as a father and as a mother — and God self-identifies in a nonbinary way by simply stating, ‘I am that I am’ in Exodus 3:14,” Teng says. “If we can embrace a God who transforms to become a human, then it really isn’t a far stretch to believe a person might transform their gender in the same way.” The idea of God as trans and/or nonbinary is validating for those who don’t believe humans can be boxed into genders.",
            "Teng’s queer, embodied theology has revolutionized her spiritual experience. Studying queer theology brought her to the realization that her queerness is good, holy and can be a reflection of a divine being beyond our limited imaginations. Now she aims to bring that revolutionary insight to others. She believes healing the physiological trauma from religious persecution can help us realize and feel divinity.",
            "In many religious traditions, queer bodies are policed and punished instead of celebrated and sanctified. In the mainstream religious imagination, we are simply cautionary tales. Some queer spiritual leaders believe that changing the narrative around queer spirituality is part of reconciling our religious experience. “A big part of my work right now is telling spiritual stories — my own and those in the community,” says Caitlin Breedlove, vice president of movement leadership at Auburn Seminary in Phoenix. Queer spirituality, Breedlove reminds us, is not new. “There are ancient ways of understanding spirituality and our spiritual connection that predate monotheism and contemporary white supremacy and capitalism.”",
            "Centering stories instead of antiquated patriarchal lore serves queer people. It engages spiritually minded queers in more expansive ideas rooted in the world and community. “Many are yearning to know more,” she says.",
            "Breedlove sees a change in spiritual spaces. She believes more is possible and necessary, as many traditional faith organizations are at least somewhat accepting of queerness. “I would love to see the boldest theologies right now.”",
            "A more radical queer spiritual future is what Breedlove is conceptualizing — one that requires our active participation. “We are still conforming our theology to outdated shapes, patterns and stories. We require the ancient, and we require the new in our theology.” Breedlove believes queer theology would come primarily from Indigenous wisdom, Black liberation teachings, communally queer understandings and spiritual knowledge that comes from the margins. Our queer spiritual work is also sociopolitical work.",
            "Queer spiritual spaces that center on ideas of inclusivity often end up evolving communities in unexpected ways. An online community space called enfleshed started to fill a need for queer Christians but has ended up serving people of many faiths and practices. “We began enfleshed solidly on the fringes of the Christian tradition but have evolved into some broader directions,” says Rev. M Jade Kaiser, director of enfleshed in Iowa.",
            "enfleshed is a collective space of creative spiritual resources designed to support people who want to practice a more liberating spirituality — individually and collectively, says Kaiser. They have no explicit dogma, Christian or otherwise. Instead, what you find at enfleshed is mostly ideas for practices intended to help move individuals creatively towards personal and collective liberation. I know that sounds a little woo, but their eponymous newsletter is full of essays and suggestions for practices that are thought-provoking and practical.",
            "I can feel those stories told by the many artists and thinkers, who comprise enfleshed, in the tender meat of my heart. As Breedlove mentioned, even hearing queer stories of spiritual practice and transformation feels revolutionary. Teng’s work, and the like, help me understand how my spiritual wounds have changed the way I move in my body and the world. It gives me hope for healing.",
            "Old-time religion gave us the soul-crushing misconception that queer people don’t deserve God. We’ve been mostly denied entry into many houses of worship, much less the pearly gates of heaven. But we are no longer accepting that rejection as evidence of our original sin. Instead, we are reconceptualizing religion and spirituality in pursuit of both personal liberation and healing the collective. Queer people aren’t coming for your old gods, we’re making God anew.",
            "I see a new trinity emerging in this queer spiritual revolution: body, story and collective. These are the places where we can find the inspiration to enliven our world, animate our bodies and speak a language suited to the soul. This is a trinity without hierarchy. Contemporary queer spiritual leaders know that we must address all three at once to help us move, not just away from the harms of the past but toward new visions of healing for our collective future."

            "“As his followers stormed the Capitol, calling on his vice president to be hanged, President Donald Trump sat in his private dining room, watching TV, doing nothing,” the editorial begins. “For three hours, seven minutes.”",
            "The editorial by the right-wing tabloid, controlled by longtime Trump supporter Rupert Murdoch, follows the Jan. 6 House select committee’s investigation into Trump’s inaction, which on Thursday laid out Trump’s unwillingness to call off the violence.",
            "“Trump only wanted one thing during that infamous afternoon: to pressure Vice President Mike Pence to decertify the election of Joe Biden,” the editorial board said. “He thought the violence of his loyal followers would make Pence crack, or delay the vote altogether.”",
            "On the same day, the Wall Street Journal ran a piece from their editorial board titled “The President Who Stood Still on Jan. 6.”",
            "The Wall Street Journal is also owned by Murdoch.",
            "“Mr. Trump took an oath to defend the Constitution, and he had a duty as Commander in Chief to protect the Capitol from a mob attacking it in his name. He refused,” the article read.",
            "“In the 18 months since, Mr. Trump has shown not an iota of regret,” the editorial continued. “On Thursday he claimed to be vindicated by a bill to clarify the Electoral Count Act...Character is revealed in a crisis, and Mr. Pence passed his Jan. 6 trial. Mr. Trump utterly failed his.”",
            "Last month, the Post’s editorial board called Trump a “prisoner of his own ego” for his inability to admit the 2020 presidential election was not stolen from him. The board added that the GOP should leave Trump behind.",

            "PHOENIX — It was a sweltering Arizona evening in late June, and Kari Lake was standing on a stage in a church community center in front of a giant poster of Kari Lake.",
            "The promotional material for Lake’s campaign for governor featured Lake’s head and shoulders, floating alongside Donald Trump’s head and shoulders, with a quote from Trump: “Kari Lake is fantastic. She is going to win big.”",
            "Trump’s endorsee was about to be interviewed by a reporter for a Japanese TV station in Gold Canyon, an upscale Phoenix suburb at the base of a mountain. Lake’s own video team hovered in the background, capturing her every move. It was a million degrees and Lake was dry as a cactus.",
            "It wasn’t long into the interview that Lake turned to two of her favorite subjects: Trump and the media.",
            "“People of this country love Donald Trump,” Lake said. “It’s the corrupt, rotten media that’s been trying to tell them and brainwash them into believing that people don’t like him.”",
            "Lake’s remarks about a “corrupt” and “rotten” media are especially breathtaking considering the source: a former newscaster who, less than two years ago, was still delivering the news in one of the nation’s largest media markets.",
            "“I want you to know if the Arizona ‘Repugnant,’ as I’ve taken to calling it” — Lake’s derisive nickname for the Arizona Republic newspaper — “if CNN and MSNBC are attacking people, those are the people you want to vote for,” Lake told the crowd at a candidate forum just prior to her interview with the Japanese station.",
            "How Lake came to leave the media — or at least the story she tells about why she left the media — is the foundational story of her outsider campaign for governor. It also mirrors the trajectory of the far right’s accelerating break with reality during the COVID pandemic and in the aftermath of the 2020 election, a rupture driven by actual fake news and propaganda.",
            "Lake, whose previous job involved discerning fact from fiction, is now closely aligned with the cowboy-hat-sporting state lawmaker Mark Finchem, a Trump-backed promoter of election falsehoods running for the role of chief elections officer. Together they help form the ranks of candidates who claim the 2020 election was “corrupt” and “stolen,” and both recently suggested, without credible evidence, that 2022’s results may be compromised, too. Lake has also been endorsed by a slate of extremist figures tied to Trump, including former national security adviser Michael Flynn, U.S. Rep. Paul Gosar (Ariz.), MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, and Arizona state Sen. Wendy Rogers — the fringes of the fringe.",
            "Earlier this year, Lake was featured in promotional materials for the America First Political Action Conference, the extremist gathering organized by 23-year-old white nationalist Nick Fuentes. Lake responded that she was “not taking part” in the event and called it a “false photo.” Fuentes’ followers turned on Lake, but Fuentes defended her. “There was a scheduling mix-up with Kari Lake! Just a misunderstanding. Take it easy on her we support her,” he posted on Telegram after the dust-up.",
            "There’s at least one commonly agreed-upon reality in this race: Lake is resonating with the GOP base. With two weeks to go until the Aug. 2 primary, Lake has consistently led in polling of the GOP field. Although more recent polling suggests the race tightened after Doug Ducey, Arizona’s moderate, term-limited Republican governor — who also leads the national fundraising campaign for GOP governors — endorsed her main rival, developer Karrin Taylor Robson, a move that fanned the flames of Ducey’s proxy war with Trump. On Monday, former Vice President Mike Pence also threw his support behind the more establishment-friendly Taylor Robson.",
            "If Lake wins the Republican nomination, she will likely face Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs in a general election that Republicans are signaling they may use to relitigate, for the umpteenth time, the 2020 election results in a state that became known for its widely discredited election audit. In a debate this month, Lake pushed the stolen election narrative as a litmus test for the GOP field. In April, she and Finchem sued state and county officials to try and ban the use of electronic voting machines in this year’s election.",
            "“It’s election denier against election defender,” said Chuck Coughlin, a veteran GOP strategist in Arizona, framing the hypothetical matchup between Lake and Hobbs.",
            "Lake, 52, is a charismatic, made-for-TV candidate entirely in Trump’s mold — if Trump happened to be a woman with high cheekbones and a pixie haircut. Like Trump, Lake has spent decades on TV. Unlike the former president, Lake was primarily a local news anchor, spending a majority of her career at Fox’s Phoenix station. Lake even interviewed Trump twice before following him down the golden escalator.",
            "Combative, hard-right MAGA warrior is a new look for Lake, and as a necessary feature of that image, Lake has turned against the reporters who were once her colleagues.",
            "“It’s a vitriolic relationship with the media. She won’t talk to anybody without it being on her terms,” said Coughlin. “She’s a diva of her own persona — the television news personality who just doesn’t believe the news.”",
            "Lake’s remarks about her former profession make you wonder how she stuck it out for as long as she did. Lake has called the media “criminal” and said that some journalists “probably should be locked up.” After leaving her job at Fox in March of last year, Lake launched her campaign for governor three months later by bashing a set of TVs and declaring, “it’s time to take a sledgehammer to the mainstream media’s lies and propaganda.”",
            "Lake now likes to turn the tables on her former industry colleagues.",
            "Last month, Lake’s video team captured and edited a clip of her declining an interview with a CNN reporter outside of an event. The clip went viral, and the reporter’s face during the interaction became a meme on the right. Lake’s campaign suggested to me a day earlier that Lake actually had plans to sit down with the network, but the campaign is known for baiting reporters, then packaging the resulting cringe into viral clips. Lake’s ever-present video team is led by her husband, Jeff Halperin, who owns a video production company. Lake’s teenage daughter is also paid to consult on her campaign, the Arizona Republic reported.",
            "HuffPost sent Lake a detailed request for fact-checking and comments for this piece, but Lake’s campaign declined to provide answers to any specific questions: “It is very obvious that HuffPost is gearing up for a smear piece. Your line of questioning has zero truth behind it ... Dr. Evil’s Washington Post tried the same type of smear. And it backfired. Do you leftist rags not realize that voters see this and laugh at you?”",
            "“Why won’t you write about Kari’s policies? Her homeless policy? Her border policy? Her education policy?” the response continued. “You exist solely as a Propaganda Mill for the Left and no one is buying your BS. Run your trash story, the people of Arizona know Kari Lake look [sic] forward to electing her Governor.”",
            "In Arizona, Lake agreed to a 10-minute interview with HuffPost, on the implied condition that her campaign be allowed to record it, positioning us squarely in Lake’s wheelhouse.",
            "Lake and I sat stiffly facing each other on a bench outside the church building in Gold Canyon. Asked if there was a specific moment when it became clear to her she could no longer be a journalist, Lake went back to the start of the pandemic.",
            "“I’ve always seen that modern-day journalism in America has really pushed to the left, obviously. But I felt that I was a voice of reason in the newsroom,” Lake told me, at the same time that she seemed to be fishing for an opening to meme me.",
            "“Really during COVID is when I went, ‘What is going on here?’ Things weren’t making sense.”",
            "‘Embarrassed By The Mud She Splashed’",
            "Watching them now, Lake’s two MAGA rally-adjacent interviews with Trump don’t give any inkling of what was ahead — except when in early 2020 Trump seems to override his handlers to give Lake extra time to ask him questions (Lake also interviewed President Barack Obama in 2016).",
            "But at work and online, Lake was gaining a reputation for amplifying conspiracy theories that would touch on the election and the coronavirus. Lake was also promoting her presence on far-right social media sites, like the now-defunct Parler and Gab, a platform favored by anti-Semites.",
            "Lake’s connection to a fact-based world became even more tenuous when she began running for office. She has since been linked to Ron Watkins, the rumored leader of the QAnon movement, which believes the nation’s elites are running a secret child sex trafficking ring. The man alleged to be “Q” himself (Watkins has strongly denied being the voice behind Q’s writings, but has admitted his general involvement in the QAnon movement) is also running for office as a Republican in Democrat Tom O’Halleran’s eastern Arizona congressional district. Watkins posted a photo on Telegram last year claiming he had dinner with Lake. Lake’s campaign didn’t respond to a request for comment about her relationship with Watkins or Nick Fuentes.",
            "The events of recent years provide a striking contrast to how Lake describes her younger self to audiences. As a 24-year-old rising TV anchor, Lake drove her “packed, late-model used car” from Iowa to Arizona to pursue a career in journalism, leaving behind a family with seven sisters and a brother. Lake told HuffPost she got into journalism because she “loves telling people’s stories. I like being in the middle of what’s happening. And it really was a wonderful career for most of the time. But it just got to the point where it was becoming propaganda, and when I realized that I had to get out.”",
            "Scott Jones, a former TV news director who runs FTVLive, a gossip blog covering the cable news industry, said Lake was “certainly big and well-liked in Phoenix. And for a long time while she was doing the job, she was a real journalist. And then slowly this change happened, where she became infected with the radical right-wing disease.”",
            "That change unfolded publicly over the latter half of Trump’s presidency, according to people in Lake’s personal and professional orbit who’ve followed her career.",
            "In 2018, while Lake was still at Fox, she tweeted that a grassroots movement to raise teacher pay was actually cover for a ploy to legalize pot. Lake later deleted the tweet and apologized. Another time, Lake was caught on a hot mic ridiculing the Phoenix New Times, calling the city’s spunky alt-weekly a “rag for selling marijuana” after they reported on her joining Parler.",
            "“Lake was starting to make these statements, usually on Twitter or somewhere on social media. She would get in trouble and go off the air for a little while. Fox would never say if they suspended her or not,” Jones said.",
            "Lake’s station wouldn’t elaborate on her tenure there, beyond confirming her final day of employment on March 1, 2021. Lake’s campaign also wouldn’t comment on her extended breaks or the specifics of her departure.",
            "While Lake was taking family medical leave from her job in early 2021, Jones reported that she was spotted at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Florida (which Lake attended this year as a featured speaker). Lake announced her resignation from Fox 10 not long after.",
            "Lake left the station with people “completely embarrassed by her,” Jones said. “They’re embarrassed by the mud she splashed on the station, and they’re mad with management who let her continue to get away with it, especially late in her career.”",
            "Diana Pike, a former HR director for Fox who was one of Lake’s supervisors for 20 years, said Lake generally had good performance reviews and doesn’t ever recall her being formally reprimanded. But Lake’s wielding of social media to share her opinions eventually became a headache for her managers.",
            "“That’s where 2018 and 2019 start to become real hot for her with regards to her posting information on Parler. We had to talk to her and say, ‘You can’t say this,’ ‘You can’t say any of this stuff,’” said Pike, who retired from the station in 2019. Pike said Lake was told “she couldn’t represent Fox with radical comments.”",
            "Another former station employee said Lake was “really good” in a supportive role with her former co-anchor. “I don’t have any ill will toward her or any negative feelings about her personally. All I can say is that I’m perplexed, like a lot of people, why she turned into this mean girl. She’s like a mean girl in middle school.”",
            "Lake’s long career allowed her to enter politics with a recognizable name and brand, although a number of Republicans at GOP events questioned Lake’s conservative credentials. Borrowing liberally from her personal reserves to fund her campaign, Taylor Robson has run several ads underscoring for voters that Lake was a registered Democrat from 2008 to 2012. Lake also gave money to Barack Obama and John Kerry under her married name, contributions she described to local media outlets as being on behalf of her family.",
            "But more were won over by Lake’s disavowal of a corporate media industry that’s viewed on the right with intense skepticism, if not outright scorn.",
            "“All we want is the truth and we don’t feel like we’re getting the truth,” said Gold Canyon GOP co-chairman Pam Burks, who was impressed with Lake and introduced her to the group as a “symbol of truth in journalism.”",
            "“I’ve always liked Kari and I’ve always liked what she has to say because she’s articulate and she understands the business of the media,” said Kevin Brislawn, a retired 70-year-old who also heard from Finchem and Senate candidate Jim Lamon, an Alabama-born businessman, at the forum.",
            "“Communication is a gift of hers,” another attendee said of Lake. “I feel like she’s going to speak the truth and not be so aggressive about it.”",
            "‘Defending All That’",
            "While Lake throws bombs in her primary, Katie Hobbs, Arizona’s Democratic secretary of state and the presumed front-runner for her party’s nomination for governor, has been trying to steer clear of the wreckage.",
            "Hobbs is also someone you’d recognize from TV. At the height of the circus surrounding the 2020 election and the GOP’s partisan election audit, Hobbs was on the cable news circuit, providing commentary as Arizona’s top election official, and blasting the partisan audit as a “joke.”",
            "I met Hobbs last month for morning coffee in an artsy neighborhood on the outskirts of downtown Phoenix. Hobbs, 52, wears her hair in a silver-gray bob with cat-eye glasses. She was friendly but guarded. It was clear Hobbs understands how the race will be framed if she and Lake are opponents.",
            "“I don’t want to say overshadow, but the 2020 election is playing such a huge role in this race — and not just the election overall, but this race in particular,” Hobbs said, adding that Lake is “the biggest cheerleader promoting Trump’s lies about the election and my role defending all that.”",
            "Hobbs’ role “defending all that” has become an all-consuming aspect of the job the former social worker has held since 2019. “That’s the situation I’ve been in for a while,” she said. “I’m not gonna back down from telling the truth of what happened — that our elections were conducted with integrity and according to the laws that are in place, that every voter can have confidence that the results are accurate, and there’s literally no evidence to the contrary.”",
            "Defending the election also means that Hobbs routinely faces violent threats, which began pouring in regularly after her criticism of the partisan audit. Hobbs usually travels with a private security detail paid for by Every Eligible American, a nonprofit.",
            "Against that backdrop, Hobbs paid extra close attention to a man who started scaling a parking structure in the middle of our interview. It was weird, but also not the kind of city occurrence you would necessarily bat an eye at unless you happened to be a frequent recipient of death threats. Hobbs looked rattled.",
            "“I don’t think about it,” Hobbs said of the specific threats she’s faced since the 2020 election, “or else I would never leave my house.”",
            "While Hobbs is well positioned for the Democratic nomination, her campaign has been dogged by a yearsold discrimination case brought by a former Black female staffer for state Senate Democrats, and the campaign’s bungled response. As the Arizona Senate’s top Democrat at the time, Hobbs apologized for the staffer’s firing, but it has become a potent line of attack for Hobbs’ primary opponent, former Nogales mayor Marco Lopez. Hobbs told HuffPost that she has taken “responsibility” and “accountability” for her role in the firing.",
            "Even with a candidate that some consider flawed, Democrats have a better shot of winning the governorship against a polarizing Republican like Lake, who may have a tougher time pulling together a coalition of moderates and independents to win a general election in a diversifying state. The presumptive GOP front-runner has tried to strengthen her appeal with plans to tackle border security and homelessness.",
            "Lake has mastered messaging around “the media is bad, Trump was cheated out of the election, big brother’s forcing us to wear a mask, as all that. That’s her game. She talks it up better than anybody,” said Tyler Montague, an Arizona-based GOP operative. “But she’s a quarter-inch deep. She literally can’t get off those topics, otherwise she’s in trouble.”",
            "Carolina Rodriguez-Greer, the Arizona director for Latino GOTV organization Mi Familia Vota, said people are sick of looking back to the 2020 election, when Joe Biden won the state by less than a percentage point, setting off all manner of election conspiracy.",
            "“We still have people that believe that the election results were not true, even though we’ve already gone through two audits that have been paid for by the taxpayers,” she said. “That narrative is extremely dangerous.”",
            "‘This Is All An Act’",
            "Probably one of the more unexpected narratives to arise from the governor’s race came last month, when Phoenix drag star Barbra Seville, aka Richard Stevens, released photos and private messages he exchanged with Lake over the course of their two-decade acquaintanceship.",
            "Stevens took issue with Lake tweeting, “They kicked God out of schools and welcomed the Drag Queens. They took down our Flag and replaced it with a rainbow.” Lake has also echoed GOP hysteria over drag and “grooming” children.",
            "According to Stevens, his former friend had once hired him to perform at a baby shower in drag, in front of children, a bomb meant to show Lake’s hypocrisy on the issue. Stevens also performed for Lake once at her birthday and at “some of the seediest bars in Phoenix,” he wrote on Facebook.",
            "The story caused enough of a stir that Lake’s campaign sent a cease-and-desist letter to Stevens warning him to stop making certain claims about Lake. Her campaign confirmed to The Washington Post that Stevens was “a friend” and that Lake once attended an event with “a Marilyn Monroe impersonator.” A campaign spokesperson told the newspaper that Stevens’ Facebook post contained “defamatory lies” and that Lake would pursue legal action.",
            "Lake and Stevens bonded over makeup and Madonna, Stevens said over the phone last month, sounding almost wistful about his onetime friend. He said Lake started coming to his shows in the late ’90s and they struck up a casual friendship that lasted years. Lake’s campaign didn’t respond to questions about her relationship with Stevens.",
            "“I knew her as very level-headed. I found her to be middle-of-the-road liberal. She and I, we didn’t have in-depth conversations about politics, but it wasn’t uncommon to talk about news and current events because that’s what we bonded over,” he said.",
            "The idea that Lake isn’t who she says she is has haunted her entry into politics. And it might be what undoes her campaign.",
            "“I think Karrin Taylor Robson will be the best person to be a fresh new leader for the state of Arizona,” Ducey, Arizona’s governor, said last weekend on CNN, lending his political heft to Lake’s rival. “Her opponent, on the other hand, bears no resemblance — her campaign or even her personal interactions with me — to anything she’s done over the past 30 years. This is all an act.”",
            "Days later, Fox News uncovered a Facebook post from Lake where she called Trump “not my president” just before his 2017 inauguration, raising the question of exactly when Lake became a full-throated Trump supporter. Fox reported the post disappeared from Lake’s page once a reporter had reached out for comment.",
            "Pike, Lake’s former supervisor, said Lake “makes it sound like she’s everyman, and she’s not everyman,” adding that Lake was “well paid” for working at the station, something Lake also acknowledges on the campaign trail when she discusses walking away from a “very large salary.”",
            "A Republican and a Trump voter in 2016, Pike posted critically on Facebook about Lake’s run for governor and several of her former Fox colleagues chimed in with similar comments. Taylor Robson’s campaign found Pike and cast her in a campaign ad, in which Pike calls Lake an “actress” and a “pretender.”",
            "Pike said she spoke out because many of her former colleagues are bound by nondisclosure agreements.",
            "“I just don’t see Kari as an ethical person, an adult,” she said. “I can’t imagine her as governor. She couldn’t lead a newsroom of 100 people. She can’t lead a state.”",
            "Asked whether she’s tried to bring up her concerns with how the news is being reported with her former colleagues, Lake said: “Now, I don’t really have a lot of relationships [with them] ... I’m so busy.”",
            "Lake continued: “Every journalist pushes stories. They push an interesting topic they want to get covered. Obviously, those stories weren’t being covered. So as a journalist, when you’re pushing them and they’re not being covered, you start to read the writing on the wall and you go, ‘Wow, not an interest in these stories. Not an interest in the full truth.’ And so I walked away.”"

            "Chelsea Handler says she’s been on an “emotional rollercoaster” since ending her relationship with fellow comedian Jo Koy after less than a year.",
            "Handler candidly spoke about when and why things started not working between the two, and how that led to their split, which she says happened about a month ago.",
            "“My love was so big that it just blew me open,” Handler said, sounding like she was on the verge of tears, during an appearance on the podcast “We Can Do Hard Things with Glennon Doyle” on Thursday.",
            "The former late night host made it sound like she was the one who ended things with Koy after experiencing issues for “some time.”",
            "“We’ve been dealing with this behind the scenes for a while,” Handler said, adding that the two were previously trying to work things out in therapy.",
            "“I think that when you have the grounding and the courage to say that, you know, something isn’t working, you’re saying a lot more than that to the whole world,” she said, still clearly emotional. “And you’re inviting in things that are going to be workable, and more suited to your needs and what you’re available for.”",
            "Doyle asked Handler when it was the time to “stop digging” in a relationship, and she provided a very honest answer.",
            "“I think when it becomes untenable. And it becomes unhealthy,” Handler said. “If you’re arguing, you know, it’s devolving. If you can’t have conversations that are calm and loving, and constant, and you’re not a team ― not feeling like a team ― then it becomes untenable.”",
            "“I wasn’t going to abandon myself,” the comedian added. “And if I have to choose one person, I have to choose myself.”",
            "“It’s nice to bend for people, it’s nice to learn how to compromise. It’s nice to learn how to demonstrate my love publicly. That’s something I was never able to do for anybody, but I believe Jo needed that,” Handler explained. “I was so inspired by us ... but Jo didn’t crack me open. My psychiatrist cracked me open, and then I was open.”",
            "“And then I was able to bend for somebody and move and compromise, and make them the biggest part of my life, but you can’t change somebody intrinsically,” she said. “And, I was willing to do so much bending, but there’s a line. And I’m very proud of myself that I didn’t let myself cross that line.”",
            "Handler said that she’s doing “okay” and feels “optimistic about the future now.”",
            "“I still believe that my person is coming. Whether that is Jo Koy at a certain time or if it’s not, like, I accept that,” Handler said.",
            "Handler and Koy publicly announced that they were ending their relationship on Tuesday, and also posted a video they’d made in anticipation of their upcoming one-year anniversary.",
            "“It is with a heavy heart to announce that we have decided together that it is best for us to take a break from our relationship right now,” Handler said at the time, calling her ex “one of the greatest gifts of my life.”",
            "Koy, in a breakup post of his own, said he was Handler’s “biggest fan” and promised the two “will always remain great friends and will always have love for one another.”"

            "The House passed the Right to Contraception Act on Thursday ― a bill that codifies the right to birth control and other contraceptives amid fears that the Supreme Court may come for that aspect of reproductive health care next after the high court repealed Roe v. Wade’s protection of abortion rights last month.",
            "The bill passed despite 195 Republicans who voted against the bill in a final vote of 228 to 195. Republicans who voted against the legislation included Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Paul Gosar (Ariz.), Jack Bergman (Mich.) and Joe Wilson (S.C.). Just eight Republicans voted in favor of the bill.",
            "The Senate recently introduced a companion measure that will likely see a vote sometime next week. Despite the flurry of action on reproductive rights in the House, all of the recently passed health care rights bills are likely doomed to die by filibuster in the Senate.",
            "The Right to Contraception Act, introduced by Rep. Kathy Manning (D-N.C.), codifies the right to birth control into federal law by creating a statutory right for people to obtain and use contraceptives, as well as codifying protections for physicians who provide contraceptives. The bill protects a range of contraceptives approved by the Food and Drug Administration and defines contraception as any “action taken to prevent pregnancy, including the use of contraceptives or fertility-awareness based methods, and sterilization procedures.”",
            "The bill authorizes the Department of Justice to take civil action against any federal or state official who attempts to restrict birth control access, and it allows those affected to also take civil action against anyone who attempts to enforce any restriction on contraception.",
            "“It is clear that their attempts to roll back the clock on contraception is again another plank on their extreme agenda for American women,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said at a Wednesday news conference before the vote.",
            "“Let us be clear: We are not going back ― for our daughters, for our granddaughters,” Pelosi added.",
            "The legislation is a direct response to Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote in a concurring opinion in the ruling that overturned Roe that the court should also reconsider the landmark 1965 decision in Griswold v. Connecticut, which protects the right to buy and use contraceptives without government interference."

            "Truss also did not resign from cabinet as ministers deserted Johnson, winning the support of prominent allies of the outgoing prime minister including Nadine Dorries and Jacob Rees-Mogg.",
            "In her current job at the Foreign Office, Truss has been hawkish about the need for the West to stand up to Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.",
            "But she has also been criticized for mis-steps, including her support for Britons who wanted to fly to the war-torn country and over what some have branded her “Instagram diplomacy.”",

            "He has pitched himself as the fiscally conservative candidate, attacking Truss for a “fairytale” plan to immediately cut taxes and borrow more.",
            "The 42-year-old has promised to cut taxes but to do so in a “way that’s responsible” and only “after we’ve got a grip of inflation.”",
            "His dramatic resignation from cabinet two weeks ago, while Johnson was painfully explaining to the BBC why he had given a job to a Tory MP he knew had been investigated for harassment, helped trigger the prime minister’s downfall.",
            "Johnson has not endorsed anyone in the race, but the plea during his final prime minister’s questions for his successor to “cut taxes” will be interpreted as implicit backing for Truss.",
            "Having handed out billions during the pandemic alongside slick personal PR, Sunak’s ascent seemed almost unstoppable.",
            "But the cost of living crisis as well as revelations about his wife’s tax arrangements, and the fact he held a U.S. green card while serving in government, damaged his brand.",
            "Like Johnson, Sunak was also fined by police for breaking COVID rules as he was present at the birthday gathering for Johnson in the Cabinet Room.",
            "His spring statement mini-budget in March triggered a huge backlash, with critics warning it did not do enough to help people struggling with the cost of living.",
            "Sunak moved to address those criticisms in May, with a £21 billion package of measures designed to help people pay for energy bills.",
            "While this pleased some in his party, it angered those who are instinctively against higher taxes and more borrowing.",
            "If the core of Truss’ campaign is likely to be immediate tax cuts, Sunak’s can be expected to argue he has wide national appeal and therefore the better chance of beating Labour at the next general election."

            "Herschel Walker’s Senate campaign in Georgia has been mired by scandal over just how many secret children he has fathered, allegations of domestic violence and multiple lies about his credentials. His own campaign reportedly described him as a “pathological liar,” but the race between the former NFL star and Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock isn’t over yet — and Walker could win it all.",
            "Walker’s candidacy should have been a long shot. After criticizing absent Black fathers, a racist trope, it was revealed that he has three secret children. He has repeatedly fumbled when discussing major policy issues, including climate change.",
            "“Since we don’t control the air, our good air decided to float over to China’s bad air, so when China gets our good air, their bad air got to move,” Walker said earlier this month while discussing the Green New Deal. “So it moves over to our good air space. Then, now, we got we to clean that back up.”",
            "But poll numbers show that this race isn’t over yet.",
            "An AARP Georgia poll from this month saw the two candidates in a close race, with Warnock leading Walker 50% to 47%; a Data for Progress poll, also from this month, had Walker leading 49% to 47%. And even though a June Quinnipiac College poll showed Walker down by double digits, he was still doing well with the traditional Republican base: He led Warnock 52% to 45% among men, 62% to 35% with white voters, and 52% to 45% with those 65 or older.",
            "Part of the appeal is his status as a football hero.",
            "Walker played on the University of Georgia team that won the national championship in 1980, a feat the university didn’t achieve again until 2021. Whenever Walker would make an appearance at the university’s football stadium, he’d receive a standing ovation. That championship is what many middle-aged Georgians remember — and love — about him.",
            "“University of Georgia football is very dominating in the state,” Trey Hood, a political science professor at University of Georgia, told HuffPost. “I don’t want to denigrate religion, but it’s really a quasi-religion down here.”",
            "“His popularity is really incredible,” he added.",
            "Republican political strategists agree that Walker’s star power is a major plus.",
            "“Democrats are going to have a hard time in trying to demonize Herschel Walker like they did Kelly Loeffler,” David Johnson, a strategist in Georgia, said in May, referring to a governor-appointed senator who failed to win her campaign last year. “And the reason is in so many people’s minds in Georgia, he’s the great UGA strong. You’re not going to be able to tarnish that.”",
            "And of course, in a deeply polarized country, simply having the right letter next to your name will garner a decent amount of votes — especially going into the midterms, which historically work out in favor of the party that isn’t in control of the White House. Georgia is a traditionally red state that went blue in 2020, but President Joe Biden’s approval rating in the state is hovering around 30% now.",
            "“There are X number of people where it doesn’t matter, they’re just going to pull the R lever,” Hood said.",
            "In June, voters at a campaign event brushed off news coverage of Walker’s many scandals. “He is a man. He’s doing right by his family. He’s doing right by the community,” Ronel Saintvil, a Black Republican voter, told The New York Times. “To me, for somebody just to bad mouth him like this, I don’t believe it’s right. They’re not focusing on the issues at hand that affect the people in Georgia. And I think that’s what’s more important.”",
            "Walker also earned some Republican bona fides by defending President Donald Trump during the 2020 Republican National Convention and claiming he was not racist.",
            "“It hurt my soul to hear the terrible names that people call Donald,” Walker said in a speech. “I take that as a personal insult, that people would think I’ve had a 37-year friendship with a racist.”",
            "“Growing up in the Deep South, I’ve seen racism up close. I know what it is. And it isn’t Donald Trump,” he said.",
            "After Trump lost the election, he propagated a lie that the election had been rigged, which culminated in an attack on the U.S. Capitol. Many Republicans showed their loyalty to the former president by embracing his lies and conspiracy theories, and Walker was no exception.",
            "In the weeks following the election, Walker called for a re-vote in some of the states won by Biden, made baseless claims about massive voter fraud, and promoted conspiracy theories about voting machines.",
            "In other words, he was the perfect Republican.",
            "Walker’s scandals — incoherent statements, blatant hypocrisy, allegations of abuse — all seem eerily familiar. Trump’s 2016 victory and his long-lasting influence in the GOP is partially due to the fact that voters embraced his style of politics. His status as a reality TV celebrity didn’t hurt either.",
            "So while Walker’s flaws are seen as a liability by Democrats, they may also be what sends him to Congress."

            "The comedian made her final appearance as a cast member on the show in May after an 11-season run, which earned her two Emmy trophies, eight nominations and a place in the history books for her impressions of a variety of celebrities and public figures, from Justin Bieber to Hillary Clinton.",
            "“I thought about it for a very long time, and it was very, very hard,” McKinnon said on Thursday’s episode of “Live With Kelly and Ryan” about her exit, according to Entertainment Weekly. “All I ever wanted to do in my whole life was be on ‘Saturday Night Live.’ So, I did, I loved it, I had the best decade, and then I was just like, my body was tired, and I felt like it was time.”",
            "McKinnon said she’s unsure whether she’ll continue to watch the series when it returns in the fall.",
            "“I don’t know what I will do. I don’t know that I can watch the show yet because it’s too emo because I miss everyone so much. It’s my family,” she added. “It’s too emo. So, I think I’m just going to take ‘The Bachelorette’ and watch it.”",
            "In the cold open of her final “SNL” episode, McKinnon reprised her fan-favorite character Colleen Rafferty, who volunteered to be abducted by aliens.",

            "“If it weren’t for COVID, I probably would have left a few years earlier,” Bryant told Variety last month. “But it was such a huge change. When COVID hit, it was so jarring that we were all like, ‘I’m definitely going to come back next year.’ And then I had to shoot ‘Shrill’ for half of last season, and so I missed a lot. And then it was like, ‘Well, now I should go back one more.’”",
            "“I kept trying to seek one last normal year,” she explained. “This year wasn’t the normal year that I hoped for, but it was closer to that. It was like, ‘OK, it’s really time now.’ And 10 felt like a nice, solid round number.”",
            "McKinnon, meanwhile, has kept busy since leaving the series with roles in Peacock’s “Joe vs Carole” and the animated film “DC League of Super-Pets,” as well as a part in the upcoming and much-buzzed-about live-action “Barbie” movie from director Greta Gerwig."

            "ATLANTA (AP) — A federal appeals court on Wednesday overturned a lower court ruling and said Georgia’s restrictive 2019 abortion law could take effect immediately. The decision wasn’t surprising after the U.S. Supreme Court last month ruled that there is no constitutional right to an abortion.",
            "The Georgia law bans most abortions once a “detectable human heartbeat” is present. Cardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound in cells within an embryo that will eventually become the heart as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, before many women realize they’re pregnant.",
            "The Georgia law includes exceptions for rape and incest, as long as a police report is filed. It also provides for later abortions when the mother’s life is at risk or a serious medical condition renders a fetus unviable.",
            "A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said that a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a Mississippi case that overturned Roe v. Wade clears the way for the law to take effect, saying it “makes clear no right to abortion exists under the Constitution, so Georgia may prohibit them.”",
            "The appeals court also rejected arguments that a “personhood” provision in the law is unconstitutionally vague. The provision grants personhood to a fetus, giving it the same legal rights as people have after birth.",
            "Generally, the court’s ruling wouldn’t take effect for several weeks, until an official mandate was issued. But the court issued a second order Wednesday that allowed the law to take effect immediately.",
            "A federal judge put the law on hold before it could take effect and in July 2020 permanently blocked it, saying it was unconstitutional under the Supreme Court precedent that was recently overturned. The state appealed to the 11th Circuit, and a three-judge panel of the appeals court last fall said it would wait for the Supreme Court ruling in the Mississippi case before taking action on Georgia’s appeal.",
            "The Supreme Court ruled on June 24 and Georgia’s attorney general asked the appeals court that afternoon to overturn the lower court ruling and allow the state’s abortion law to take effect.",
            "The 1973 decision of Roe v. Wade declared a fundamental right to an abortion prior to viability of the fetus. Planned Parenthood v. Casey narrowed that in 1992 to say states can’t place an undue burden in the way of women seeking an abortion prior to viability.",
            "Georgia’s so-called heartbeat law was one of a wave of laws passed by Republican-controlled legislatures in recent years to attack those rulings as anti-abortion activists and lawmakers saw an opportunity in a new conservative Supreme Court majority."

            "President Joe Biden on Wednesday unveiled a series of new executive actions to confront the mounting effects of global climate change following another stalled legislative push from the president and Senate Democrats to secure billions of dollars in climate and clean energy investments.",
            "Biden detailed the unilateral effort during a visit to the shuttered Brayton Point coal-fired power plant in Somerset, Massachusetts. The facility is now being transformed into a manufacturing hub for submarine cables that will be used on offshore wind farms now being developed off the East Coast.",
            "Biden called planetary warming a “clear and present danger” and said he has “a responsibility to act with urgency and resolve.”",
            "“Let me be clear: Climate change is an emergency,” he said. “In the coming weeks, I’m going to use the power I have as president to turn these words into formal, official government actions through the appropriate proclamations, executive orders and regulatory power that a president possesses. When it comes to fighting climate change, I will not take no for an answer.”",
            "The executive push includes actions to further advance the already rapidly growing U.S. offshore wind industry as well as better safeguard communities affected by extreme heat. But it falls far short of a national emergency declaration or the “beast mode” executive action that progressive lawmakers and climate hawks have demanded in recent days.",
            "“Our focus is on what we can do in light of where we find ourselves, between the urgency of action and the clarity of opportunity that’s in front of us,” a senior White House official said during a press call ahead of Biden’s speech.",
            "The Interior Department for the first time will propose establishing a pair of offshore wind areas in the Gulf of Mexico encompassing some 700,000 acres off the coasts of Texas and Louisiana. Biden also directed the Interior Department to advance offshore wind off the mid- and southern Atlantic Coast, as well as and Florida’s Gulf Coast.",
            "Biden also announced $2.3 billion in funding for FEMA’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program to help communities confront a myriad of climate impacts, from extreme heat and drought to flooding and wildfires. Those impacts have been on full display this week, as punishing heat and wildfires plague swaths of the U.S. and Europe.",
            "Finally, the Department of Health and Human Services will issue new guidance to help states leverage funding through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) in order to build community cooling centers and purchase at-home air conditioners.",
            "Last week, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) ruled out any new climate spending in a scaled-down social spending package, seemingly upending months of negotiations on Capitol Hill. Manchin subsequently said he was still open to a bigger deal that includes climate funding and that he just wanted to see July’s inflation numbers first. But public outrage had already ballooned. Climate and environmental advocates condemned the coal state Democrat for negotiating in bad faith and urged Biden to immediately use his executive powers, including declaring a national climate emergency, to curb planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.",
            "Reporting earlier this week from The Washington Post and other media outlets indicated Biden was considering, even likely, to sign an emergency declaration as soon as today. But by Tuesday, the White House had at least temporarily sidelined the idea.",
            "“The climate emergency is not going to happen tomorrow, but we still have it on the table,” Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said during a Tuesday briefing. “I don’t have a date circled in the calendar.”",
            "In the 18 months since Biden took office, many climate activists, environmental groups and progressive Democrats have repeatedly called on the president to lean into his executive powers to confront the global threat, including halting new oil and gas leases on federal lands and blocking new pipelines and other fossil fuel projects.",
            "That pressure only grew after Manchin torpedoed the climate talks on Capitol Hill last week. Democratic Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.) and Jeff Merkley (Ore.) joined those calls, urging Biden to use the Defense Production Act to boost clean energy technologies.",
            "“The potential to enact the legislation is dead,” Merkley told reporters previously. “This then frees up the president to use the full powers of the executive branch. And those full powers certainly include a climate emergency.”",
            "The White House has signaled that Biden plans to take additional executive action on climate in the coming days and weeks.",
            "Biden’s speech and the administration’s announcements Wednesday received mixed reviews from climate and environmental advocates. Many welcomed the executive actions but called on Biden to go further to rein in planet-warming fossil fuels.",
            "“We appreciate that Biden feels like the climate crisis is an emergency, but now is the time for him to act like it,” JL Andrepont, a senior policy campaigner at environmental group 350.org, said in a statement. “The planet is burning; droughts, heatwaves, and wildfires are contributing to famine and death on almost every continent, while Biden waits to officially declare a Climate Emergency, and waits to use all of the powers at his disposal to comprehensively address the climate crisis.”",
            "“What is needed right now is not more words, but action,” Andrepont said."

            "ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — Fewer manatee deaths have been recorded so far this year in Florida compared to the record-setting numbers in 2021, but wildlife officials cautioned Wednesday that chronic starvation remains a dire and ongoing threat to the marine mammals.",
            "Between Jan. 1 and July 15, about 631 manatee deaths have been confirmed by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. That compares with 864 during the same period last year, when a record number of manatees died mainly from a lack of seagrass food, which was decimated by water pollution. The five-year average of manatee deaths in that time frame is 481.",
            "Despite some glimmers of hope, wildlife officials said during a news conference Wednesday that manatees continue to face dwindling food options and many survivors have been severely weakened by malnutrition, which leaves them more vulnerable once cold weather sets in.",
            "How manatees fare this summer when more food is available will determine how they survive in winter, said Martine de Wit, a veterinarian overseeing necropsies and coordinating rescues of ill manatees for the state wildlife commission.",
            "“There is not enough high-quality food for the animals,” de Wit said, showing slides of necropsied animals with severe internal damage from starvation. “It’s going to be long lasting. It’s going to be years before you can measure the real effect.”",
            "Manatees, the large, round-tailed mammals also known as sea cows, were already listed as a threatened species when the unprecedented die-off became apparent about a year ago. The main cause is pollution from agriculture, septic tanks, urban runoff and other sources that is killing the coastal seagrass on which the marine mammals rely.",
            "That led to an experimental feeding program last year in which more than 202,000 pounds (91,600 kilograms) of lettuce funded mainly by donations was fed to manatees that traditionally gather during winter in the warm waters near a power plant on Florida’s east coast. Officials say they are still studying the impact of that feeding program and weighing whether to do it again as temperatures drop this winter.",
            "“Did it have an effect? I’d like to think that it did,” said Tom Reinert, a regional director for the wildlife commission. “We’re working day in and day out to make sure we’re prepared for next winter.”",
            "There are about 7,500 manatees in the wild in Florida, according to wildlife commission figures. They have long struggled to coexist with humans. Seagrass-killing pollution and boat strikes are now the main threats facing the beloved creatures.",
            "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recently agreed in a court settlement to publish a proposed manatee critical habitat revision by September 2024. The agreement came in a long-running court case involving the Center for Biological Diversity, Defenders of Wildlife and the Save the Manatee Club.",
            "The rule would bring enhanced federal scrutiny to projects that might affect the manatee in waterways in which the marine mammals are known to concentrate, such as the Indian River Lagoon on Florida’s east coast. In addition, the state is spending $8.5 million on a variety of manatee projects, such as restoration of seagrass and improvements in water quality.",
            "Anyone who sees a sick or dead manatee should call the wildlife commission hotline at at 888-404-FWCC (888-404-3922)."

            "Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick, Delaware Chancery Court’s head judge, agreed to Twitter’s request for an expedited trial date, pointing to the damage a prolonged legal struggle would cause to its business.",
            "A delayed trial date requested by Musk “threatens irreparable harm to the sellers and to Twitter,” McCormick said, according to The Washington Post.",
            "Twitter sued Musk earlier this month after he announced he was pulling out of an agreement to buy the company. Twitter sought an expedited trial — an issue McCormick settled on Tuesday.",
            "Musk’s lawyers argued the trial should happen in February 2023 at the earliest because of the complexity of the case, saying they needed more time to further investigate Musk’s contention that Twitter was misstating the amount of spam bots on the platform.",
            "McCormick rejected the argument, saying it “underestimates ability of this court to quickly process litigation.”",
            "Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, told The Associated Press, the decision is a win for Twitter “in terms of moving things along.”",
            "The judge, Tobias added, “seemed very concerned about the argument that delay would seriously harm the company, and I think that’s true.”",
            "This was the first time the two sides appeared before a judge, setting the stage for a contentious trial. The hearing was held via Zoom, as McCormick had tested positive for COVID.",
            "Twitter lawyer William Savitt called Musk as a “committed enemy” to the social media giant, according to CNN.",
            "Musk defense lawyer Andrew Rossman said the claim was “preposterous,” noting that Musk is still the company’s second-largest shareholder, with a “far larger stake” in Twitter than the entire board of directors, according to AP.",
            "Rossman reiterated Musk’s concerns that Twitter is underestimating the amount of spam bots. The company has repeatedly said spam accounts represent less than 5% of monetizable daily active users.",
            "“We have reason to believe, based on what we’ve seen so far, that the real numbers are significantly higher, with enormous implications for the long-term value of the company,” Rossman said, according to CNN.",
            "Still, Musk’s purchase agreement was never contingent on the amount of spam bots, and Twitter never promised Musk the figure was under 5%. Musk also waived his due diligence to close the deal faster.",
            "“Nothing in the merger agreement turns on that question,” Savitt said. “There is no representation or warranty in the merger that is related to how many false accounts there may be on Twitter.”",
            "Though both sides seemed set for a courtroom showdown, Twitter’s lawsuit against Musk still could be resolved in various ways, including a settlement.",

            "James Howard Jackson, 19, was one of five people arrested in connection the violent robbery in February 2021. He was facing an attempted murder charge when he was released from Los Angeles County’s jail “due to a clerical error.”",
            "Detectives do not believe that the thieves initially knew the dogs belonged to the pop star, who was in Rome filming a movie at the time. The motive was supposedly the value of the French bulldogs — which can run into the thousands of dollars. The dogs were later returned by a woman who claimed she’d found them; she was later arrested and found to be in a relationship with another suspect’s father.",
            "U.S. Marshals, in a statement Monday, said Jackson should be considered armed and dangerous. The reward is for information that leads to his arrest. Authorities previously said Jackson is a documented gang member but have not provided additional information.",
            "Representatives for Lady Gaga did not immediately return a request for comment Wednesday.",
            "The dog walker, Ryan Fischer, was with Lady Gaga’s three dogs — named Asia, Koji and Gustav — in Hollywood just off the famed Sunset Boulevard when he was attacked.",
            "Video from the doorbell camera of a nearby home shows a white sedan pulling up and two men jumping out. They struggled with Fischer and one pulled a gun and fired a single shot before fleeing with two of the dogs, Koji and Gustav. The video captured Fischer screaming, “Oh, my God! I’ve been shot!” and “Help me!” and “I’m bleeding out from my chest!”",
            "Fischer — who was shot once in the chest with a bullet from a .40-caliber handgun — previously called the violence “a very close call with death” in social media posts.",

            "“I miss feeling loopy and carefree sometimes, but to be honest toward the end, it didn’t give that fun feeling anymore anyhow,” the “Cravings” author wrote on Instagram. “I drank to end crazy anxiety that later mostly went away when I - get this - quit drinking! Sigh. Anyhow I feel really good.”",
            "Teigen also delved into some of the frustrating incidents she experienced because of drinking, telling followers about important things she missed or didn’t recall.",
            "“Sometimes I get really frustrated looking back on days I should remember way better than I do because of alcohol,” she wrote. “Like when I drank cafe patron and fell asleep while an Outback Steakhouse chef taught me (my friends) how to make a bloomin onion at my house. I wish I was awake for that. Wish I remembered really any awards show lol.”",
            "“There are pictures from huge moments in life where my eyes just look…gone,” Teigen added. “Some are from real work shoots, some just beach days with the family.”",
            "The model ended her message by saying she didn’t know if she’d be sober forever, but she did “know I never want to be that way again.”",
            "“And for now, none is best. I’ll let the bad dreams come up and try to sort them out in therapy, without booze,” Teigen wrote.",

            "The development, first reported by the Washington Post, came in tandem with a call from the National Archives for an investigation into the deleted texts.",
            "In a letter to the Department of Homeland Security Tuesday, the U.S. Government’s chief records officer Laurence Brewer instructed the Secret Service to investigate the matter and determine if any text messages have been improperly deleted.",
            "The Secret Service must now provide a report to the National Archives and Records Administration within 30 days, including a description of the records, an accounting of the exact circumstances surrounding their deletion, details of actions taken to salvage the records and what safeguards have been established to prevent further loss.",

            "DHS Inspector General Joseph Cuffari told the House committee investigating Jan. 6 that the texts were deleted after his office requested the records as part of a probe into the events, though the Secret Service denies this.",
            "The committee subpoenaed the Secret Service last Friday demanding the agency’s texts and records from that day. Committee member Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) told ABC that the panel hoped to get at least some of the pertinent texts by Tuesday, ahead of their next public Jan. 6 hearing, scheduled for 8 p.m. ET Thursday.",
            "The records have taken on additional importance following the bombshell testimony of Cassidy Hutchinson. Among other revelations, the aide to Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told House investigators that Trump “lunged” for the steering wheel of the presidential limo on Jan. 6 in an effort to be taken to the Capitol.",
            "While the Secret Service said it planned to dispute her testimony, the agency has yet to formally do so nearly three weeks later.",

            "The two barbers appeared together on a few episodes of the fourth season of “90 Day Fiancé” in 2019, socializing together onscreen, according to People. It remains unclear what motivated the shooting, but police noted at the time that a personal conflict caused matters to escalate.",

            "WASHINGTON (AP) — Jury selection began Monday in the trial of Steve Bannon, a one-time top adviser to former President Donald Trump. He is facing criminal contempt of Congress charges after refusing for months to cooperate with the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection.",
            "Bannon is charged in Washington’s federal court with defying a subpoena from the Jan. 6 committee that sought his records and testimony. He was indicted in November on two counts of criminal contempt of Congress, one month after the Justice Department received a congressional referral. Each count carries a minimum of 30 days of jail and as long as a year behind bars.",
            "By early afternoon, eight jurors had been seated in a slow-moving process known as voir dire. Much of the questioning of potential jurors by Bannon’s lawyer, Evan Corcoran, centered on how much of the Jan. 6 hearings they’ve watched and whether they have opinions about the committee and its work.",
            "In one case, a prospective juror flatly told U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols that remaining impartial would be “a challenge” for him since, “I do believe (Bannon) is guilty.”",
            "That admission, in addition to disqualifying the potential juror, prompted questioning of others who had sat next to the man to determine how widely he had shared his opinion.",
            "The trial follows a flurry of activity in the case since July 9. Over a week ago, the former White House strategist notified the committee that he is now willing to testify. His former lawyer, Robert Costello, said the change was because Trump had waived his executive privilege claim from preventing the testimony.",
            "Bannon, 68, had been one of the most prominent of the Trump-allied holdouts in refusing to testify before the committee. He had argued that his testimony was protected by Trump’s claim of executive privilege, which allows presidents to withhold confidential information from the courts and the executive branch.",
            "Trump has repeatedly asserted executive privilege — even though he’s a former, not current president — to try to block witness testimony and the release of White House documents. The Supreme Court in January ruled against Trump’s efforts to stop the National Archives from cooperating with the committee after a lower court judge — Ketanji Brown Jackson, now on the Supreme Court — noted, in part, “Presidents are not kings.”",
            "The committee has also noted that Trump fired Bannon from the White House in 2017 and Bannon was thus a private citizen when he was consulting with the president in the run-up to the riot.",
            "Judge Nichols declined motions to delay the contempt trial in separate hearings last week, including Thursday when Bannon’s lawyers raised concerns about a CNN report that has since aired about their client and what they said were prejudicial comments made during a hearing last week held by the House committee.",
            "“I am cognizant of current concerns about publicity and bias and whether we can seat a jury that is going to be appropriate and fair, but as I said before, I believe the appropriate course is to go through the voir dire process,” Nichols said Thursday. The judge said he intended to get a jury that “is going to be appropriate, fair and unbiased.“",
            "While the judge allowed the trial to move forward, Nichols left open the possibility that the letters about Trump waiving his privilege and Bannon’s offer to cooperate with the committee could be referenced at trial, saying the information was “at least potentially relevant” to Bannon’s defense.",
            "Roscoe Howard Jr., the former U.S. attorney in Washington, said the best case for Bannon is if the information on his cooperation offer gets to the jury. Even if it does, however, a claim that executive privilege stopped him from cooperating earlier will be a hard argument to make because Bannon refused to answer the subpoena, Howard said.",
            "“You have to show up to invoke the privilege claim. You can’t phone it in,” he said."

            "A 22-year-old from nearby Bartholomew County who was legally carrying a firearm at the mall shot and killed the gunman, Ison said at a news conference.",
            "Four of those hit by gunfire were females and one was a male, Ison said. He didn’t immediately know the specific gender or age of those who were killed.",
            "He said a 12-year-old girl was among the two injured, both of whom are in stable condition.",
            "Police confiscated a suspicious backpack that was in a bathroom near the food court, Ison said.",
            "Officers went to the mall at about 6 p.m. for reports of the shooting.",
            "“The real hero of the day is the citizen that was lawfully carrying a firearm in that food court and was able to stop the shooter almost as soon as he began,” Ison said.",
            "The mass shooting was just the latest to unnerve Americans in 2022. Schools, churches, grocery stores and a July Fourth parade in Highland Park, Illinois, have all become killing grounds in recent months.

            "Set against a furious haze of bongs, booze and cocaine trays, the trailer released on Sunday promises to tell the “the sleaziest love story in all of Hollywood” between a rising pop star (Depp) and a self-help guru and possible cult leader (Tesfaye).",

            "Not much else is known about the series apart from its troubled production, as the show has undergone multiple delays and a major creative overhaul since it was first announced in June 2021.",
            "Series director Amy Seimetz, who was set to helm all seven episodes, exited the project in April, before “Red Rocket” breakout star Suzanna Son also parted ways with the show, only to be replaced with Debby Ryan.",
            "A Deadline report later claimed that midway through filming Tesfaye was “unhappy with the creative direction of the show,” which he felt was leaning too heavily into a “female perspective” by centering Depp’s character over his own, according to sources.",
            "“The Idol’s creative team continues to build, refine, and evolve their vision for the show and they have aligned on a new creative direction,” a spokeswoman for HBO said at the time. “The production will be adjusting its cast and crew accordingly to best serve this new approach to the series.

            "“Let me just tell you that I think beating the Russians in Ukraine is the single most important thing to world peace that we’re dealing with at the moment. The Russians simply have to be defeated,” he said July 5.",
            "“Some people write me and say, ‘Well, why did we send $40 billion over there?’ Well, the answer to that is it costs us a lot more to do it later,” he said.",
            "Some of those people are in McConnell’s own party — including Donald Trump, who could be the party’s presidential nominee again in 2024.",
            "And that presents a problem for McConnell and President Joe Biden. Helping Ukraine, which started off with broad public and bipartisan support, is at risk of becoming yet another casualty of today’s polarized politics.",
            "According to Morning Consult polling, while a plurality of all voters see the United States as doing “the right amount” to help Ukraine, Republican voters were the only group more likely to say the U.S. was doing “too much,” at 28%, than too little, 25%.",
            "A June poll for the University of Maryland found that willingness to tolerate substantially or somewhat higher levels of energy prices and inflation had dropped off for Republican voters compared to overall voters in a similar March survey.",
            "With the war near a standstill in the country’s eastern region, Ukraine will have to come back for more money eventually, and if Republicans win one or both chambers of Congress, it is by no means clear more aid will be forthcoming.",
            "Rep. Matt Gaetz, the firebrand House Republican from Florida, said as much in a July 1 exchange with Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.). Answering a Tweet from Gallego that said “Fact is if the Republicans take over the House in 2022 US support to Ukraine will come to a halt,” Gaetz replied, “Ruben is correct.”",
            "At a recent rally in Anchorage, Alaska, Trump riffed on the cost so far, misstating the amount spent.",
            "“Like with Ukraine, we put up $60 billion and Europe put up $5, 6 [billion]? OK?” he said, drawing boos from the crowd. (Through early July, Congress has authorized about $54 billion for assistance not only to Ukraine, but to neighboring countries as well in response to the Russian invasion. )",
            "And Trump is by no means alone among Republicans. On the last aid package, 11 GOP senators voted against more money, including Kentucky’s Rand Paul.",
            "“We don’t have any money for anyone,” he told HuffPost. “I mean, we’re a trillion dollars in the hole every year. So any money that is allocated to send to a foreign country has to be borrowed first from another foreign country.”",
            "The outlook in the Senate is arguably better for Ukraine than in the House, with McConnell and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) presenting a mostly united front on the issue so far. In the House, where Republicans have the best chance to take over and where 57 members of the conference voted against the last aid package, the picture is murkier.",
            "Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) is expected to get the Speaker’s gavel if the GOP picks up the handful of seats it needs in the fall to win control. But McCarthy’s grip on the conference is somewhat tenuous, which could lead him to have to make promises to secure the 218 votes needed for the speakership.",
            "One obvious potential spoiler group: the House Freedom Caucus, which hounded the two most recent Republican speakers, John Boehner and Paul Ryan. Members of the group have complained about the Biden administration caring more about Ukraine’s borders than the U.S.-Mexico border.",
            "Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, one of the Freedom Caucus veterans and a vote against the last aid package, said the group has yet to talk about the issue in depth.",
            "If Republicans win, supporting further aid to Ukraine would have to be a broader, conference-wide call, he said.",
            "“It’s got to be a conference decision and, look, we haven’t won yet. We’ve got to win,” he said.",
            "Requests for comment with McCarthy’s office were not answered.",

White is running under the alias Jon McGreevey in Tuesday’s GOP primary seeking to challenge Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen, who also faces a primary contest.",
            "The Harford County Sherriff’s Office said White, an employee at an adult bookstore in Edgewood, Maryland, falsely reported in April that a girl aged 10 to 12 was being trafficked by a man at the bookstore and forced to perform sex acts on male customers. The sheriff’s office identified both the male and the young girl, and said investigators found no evidence supporting White’s allegations.",
            "“It is shameful that a candidate for public office would make up such a story and use it to further his own political agenda,” said Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey R. Gahler.",
            "Gahler also denounced an unnamed political candidate who wasn’t charged in the investigation.",
            "“It is even more appalling that another individual, who is running for a law enforcement position, would embrace such an obviously false narrative in an effort to gain political traction — nothing more,” Gahler said.",

            "Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said the U.S. has probably lost its chance to contain the ongoing outbreak of monkeypox, warning health officials were likely only detecting a “fraction” of the actual number of cases.",
            "Gottlieb made the remarks on CBS’ “Face the Nation” Sunday, telling host Margaret Brennan that while monkeypox wasn’t going to explode across the nation like the coronavirus, the U.S. should have been able to get it under control with more aggressive measures. Monkeypox, he said, has now become “firmly embedded in the community” and is likely to persist.",
            "“I think, at this point, we’ve failed to contain this,” he said. “We’re now at the cusp of this becoming an endemic virus, where this now becomes something that’s persistent that we need to continue to deal with. I think the window for getting control of this and containing it probably has closed. And, if it hasn’t closed, it’s certainly starting to close.”",
            "The CDC says there have been more than 1,800 confirmed cases of monkeypox as of July 15 in almost every U.S. state. The virus spreads primarily through close contact with infected people or animals and cases have, so far, been identified mainly in men who have sex with men.",
            "Gottlieb warned the U.S. has been making similar mistakes to contain the monkeypox outbreak as the country did at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, failing to test people early enough and not supplying enough vaccines to make it harder for the virus to spread.",
            "Some cities, including New York, have begun vaccination campaigns for those at risk of contracting the disease, but health officials have warned many more doses are needed and demand is exceeding the supply. The U.S. has ordered about 7 million doses, but many of those won’t arrive in the country for months.",
            "“We’re probably detecting just a fraction of the actual cases, because … we had for a long time a very narrow case definition on who got tested. And, by and large, we’re looking in the community of men who have sex with men and at STD clinics,” Gottlieb said. “But it’s a fact that there’s cases outside that community right now.”",
            "“We’re not picking them up because we’re not looking there,” he continued. “This has spread more broadly in the community. I wouldn’t be surprised there’s thousands of cases right now.”",

            "The Indiana physician who provided an abortion last month to a 10-year-old Ohio rape victim who could not legally obtain one in her home state was once targeted in a vicious kidnapping threat against her daughter, The Guardian reported Friday.",
            "Dr. Caitlin Bernard also was — and continues to be — ominously listed on the website of a militant anti-abortion group in South Bend, Indiana, called Right To Life Michiana, which has ties to Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett.",
            "Bernard testified in a court case last year that she was forced to stop performing abortions at a clinic in South Bend after the FBI alerted the local Planned Parenthood office that a kidnapping threat had been made against Bernard’s daughter, according to The Guardian.",
            "At the time, her name was listed among abortion doctors targeted by the Michiana group, along with information about her place of work. All of the information is still on the site.",
            "In 2006, Barrett signed a statement published in an advertisement by a group that would later merge with Michiana, saying that all signatories “defend the right to life from fertilization to natural death,” according to The Guardian. It also called Roe v. Wade, which protected women’s right to abortion for 50 years, “barbaric.”",
            "Barrett would later become a U.S. Supreme Court justice and join the conservative majority to toss out the landmark decision last month.",
            "Bernard is now being harangued by Indiana’s Republican Attorney General Todd Rokita, who has falsely claimed she failed to report the 10-year-old girl’s sexual assault and rape, which she did. Rokita was apparently unable to locate the report in his own state’s records — even though several media outlets did — before he launched an investigation.",
            "Bernard’s lawyers have fired off a cease-and-desist letter to Rokita, telling him to stop spreading lies about her or he will be sued for defamation.",
            "Bernard’s spokesperson, Kendra Barkoff Lamy, called the “personal and dangerous” threats against the doctor “devastating.”",
            "“Sadly, Dr. Bernard is not alone, and this happens to doctors like her who provide abortions across our nation,” she told the Guardian.",
            "Bernard’s cease-and-desist letter to Rokita warned that his lying attacks also threatened to incite “harassment and violence” against her.",
            "As of Saturday evening, Rokita hadn’t yet responded to Bernard’s letter. His office is reportedly “reviewing” it.",
            "Both Rokita and Republican Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan initially derided the report of the girl’s rape and being forced to cross state lines to obtain an abortion as lies — until a suspect was charged with the rape this week. Jordan quickly removed a disdainful tweet about the shocking case.",
            "Neither man has expressed any compassion for the rape victim."

            "The New York State Board of Elections scrapped 12,868 of the 52,096 signatures submitted by Zeldin in his campaign’s attempt to also get on the state’s Independence Party ballot line in November, according to the Gotham Gazette. Under New York’s voting system, candidates are allowed to appear on more than one party line on the ballot, the outlet reports.",
            "The tossed-out signatures put Zeldin under the number of 45,000 valid signatures needed to add a third party to the ballot, The Hill reported.",
            "The action stemmed from a challenge by Andrew Kolstee, secretary of the state’s Libertarian Party, and Diane Sare, an independent U.S. Senate candidate.",
            "The Libertarian Party claimed more than 11,000 of the tossed-out signatures were photocopies of previously submitted signatures, the news site reported.",
            "“The Zeldin campaign’s attempt to defraud the electorate and pose as an independent campaign by filing thousands of photocopied signatures is a slap in the face to New York State voters and the election process,” Kolstee said in a statement.",

            "A Zeldin spokesperson told the Gotham Gazette that the campaign denied making “any photocopies.”",

            "Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on Saturday said he believes the U.S. Supreme Court “was overreaching” and “clearly wrong” when it legalized same-sex marriage across the country in the 2015 landmark Obergefell v. Hodges decision.",
            "Cruz was speaking on his podcast about the differences between that case and the Supreme Court’s recent decision that overturned Roe v. Wade, which had previously protected abortion rights nationwide. He criticized the court for preventing individual states from deciding for themselves whether same-sex marriage should be allowed.",
            "“Obergefell, like Roe v. Wade, ignored two centuries of our nation’s history. Marriage was always an issue that was left to the states,” he said. “In Obergefell, the court said no, we know better than you guys do, and now every state must sanction and permit gay marriage. I think that decision was clearly wrong when it was decided. It was the court overreaching.”",
            "Cruz added that he personally doesn’t expect the court to reverse its decision, however, reasoning that “it would be more than a little chaotic” based on the number of same-sex marriages that have already legally taken place.",
            "Cruz has previously advocated for allowing individual states to outlaw same-sex marriage. For many, his desire appears closer to a reality due to last month’s Supreme Court ruling on abortion rights in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which ignited concerns that the court might overturn other decisions.",
            "Justice Clarence Thomas amplified that concern, stating in a solo concurring opinion that any decision made by the Supreme Court that was stated to be supported by the due process clause of the 14th Amendment, such as Roe v. Wade was, should be reconsidered.",
            "“Any substantive due process decision is ‘demonstrably erroneous,’” he said last month, adding that “we have a duty to ‘correct the error’ established in those precedents.”",
            "Other rulings citing the due process clause include Griswold v. Connecticut, which established the right for married couples to use contraception; Lawrence v. Texas, which prohibits states from banning sexual relations between people of the same sex; and Loving v. Virginia, which protects interracial marriage.",
            "Thomas mentioned the Obergefell, Griswold and Lawrence cases in his opinion but not did mention the Loving case, which, if overturned, could threaten his own interracial marriage."

            "“I hear the hook for ‘You Oughta Know’ come on the radio and I’m like, ‘Wow, this is a really cool hook,’” Coulier told hosts Jim Norton and Sam Roberts on SiriusXM this week. “And then I start hearing the voice. I’m like, ‘Wow! This girl can sing.’ And I had no idea that this was the record ... And then I was like, I’m listening to the lyrics going, ‘Ooh, oh, no! Oh, I can’t be this guy.’”",
            "The “Full House” star didn’t specify which ‘You Oughta Know’ lyrics tipped him off. But he did talk about another “Jagged Little Pill” track, “Right Through You,” which includes the line: “Your shake is like a fish.”",
            "“I listened to the whole record and there was a lot of familiar stuff that her and I had talked about,” he said. “Like, ‘Your shake is like a fish.’ You know, I’d go, ‘Hey, dead fish me,’ and we’d do this dead fish handshake.”",
            "Hearing the album led Coulier to some revelations about the relationship.",
            "“I started listening to it and I thought, ‘Ooh, I think I may have really hurt this woman,’” he said. “And that was my first thought.”",
            "The comedian told a similar story about “You Oughta Know” in a 2008 interview with the Calgary Herald, saying he heard the song for the first time on the radio while driving. But in 2019, he told BuzzFeed the idea of him being the “supposed subject” of the song was a “silly urban legend” fueled by media speculation.",
            "For her part, Morissette has never revealed her inspiration. She said on “Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen” in 2019 that she was “intrigued” by the fact that multiple people have claimed to be the song’s antagonist.",
            "“I just think, if you’re going to take credit for a song where I’m singing about someone being a douche or an asshole, you might not want to say, ‘Hey! That’s me!’” she said."

            "WASHINGTON — Many Republicans hailed the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision as a victory for one of their highest-profile priorities: ending abortion. But it comes with a string attached — more federal spending, which Republicans usually hate.",
            "More than 4 in 10 births in the United States — 42% in 2019 — are paid for by Medicaid, the government insurance program for the poor whose costs are split between the federal government and individual states. At an average of $18,865 per birth and with one estimate that there will be more than 150,000 extra births annually because of Dobbs, there will almost certainly be more spending.",
            "House Budget Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) said he’d like to see Congress’ fiscal umpire, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, put pen to paper on the impact of Dobbs.",
            "“I would welcome a CBO score as another way to qualify the damage the Dobbs decision will do to women across the country,” the Kentucky Democrat told HuffPost.",
            "To be clear, there are far more pressing concerns about forcing people to have babies. And even just looking at cost, Medicaid doesn’t cover all the many, many costs that come with having a baby who will become a toddler and then a child and then a teenager, and so forth.",
            "But for a party that has been so quick to raise the alarm on federal spending over programs like expanding the child tax credit, Republicans are noticeably quiet about the financial cost that outlawing abortion will have.",
            "Exactly how much more Medicaid spending Dobbs will entail is unclear. In the past, the CBO has estimated that bills restricting access to abortion would increase births and boost Medicaid spending.",
            "Those increases, though, have been relatively small compared to the program’s overall outlays. A House Republican bill in 2015 to defund Planned Parenthood would have increased Medicaid spending by $650 million over 10 years. A 2017 bill GOP bill to restrict abortions after 20 weeks would have increased Medicaid spending by $175 million over 10 years, but the boost in spending could have been as much as $335 million if more people than projected carried their pregnancies to term instead of ending them before 20 weeks.",
            "Dobbs’ impact may be several orders of magnitude higher. Taking the Kaiser estimate of $18,865 in birth costs, multiplying that by consulting firm Sg2′s high estimate of extra births and assuming the proportion of Medicaid deliveries stayed the same, the annual tab would be about $1.3 billion a year, or $13 billion over 10 years.",
            "“We don’t know how much to expect, but we know that there are going to be women who are not going to be able to gain access to abortions, they’re not going to be able to travel distances to get abortions they seek. And those births are going to be funded by Medicaid,” said Alina Salganicoff, senior vice president with the Kaiser Family Foundation.",
            "“Now, the extent to which that’s going to be something that’s noticeable in the budget, I really don’t know. A lot of it will depend on how successful women are going to be at getting abortions out of state or through self-managed means,” she said.",
            "Medicaid is a $600 billion-plus a year program, with almost 88 million Americans enrolled in it or its companion CHIP program for kids, and usually one of the top budget line items for states. It has long been a target of anti-spending conservatives who balk at both its costs and the mandates it places on states.",
            "Few Republicans this week wanted to talk about the potential cost of Dobbs. A request for comment to Rep. Jason Smith (Mo.), Yarmuth’s GOP counterpart on the House Budget Committee, was not answered. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) ignored the question as he got on an elevator during a Senate vote. Even the National Taxpayers Union did not respond to a request for comment.",
            "Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican who would likely become the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee if Republicans take the Senate, gave a muted response when questioned.",
            "“I’m not trying to reduce the deficit by denying birth,” he said after a Senate vote. “I don’t see denying birth as a deficit reduction plan that anybody supports, OK?”",
            "The budget impact will vary by state, as some provide abortions out of their state share of Medicaid money and others have banned or restricted abortions almost completely in the wake of Dobbs.",
            "States that have the most Medicaid births would probably see the biggest impact, and many of them have restricted abortion since the ruling. According to Kaiser, six states as of 2020 had half or more of their births paid for by Medicaid: Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Alabama and Texas. The highest proportion was seen in Louisiana, at 61%, while Alabama and Texas both saw half of their births paid for by Medicaid.",
            "Kaiser’s Salganicoff said there would be “downstream” impacts on Medicaid for years in addition to the costs of increased births.",
            "Salganicoff said as recently as 2014 that about 75% of women having abortions were low-income and that over 60% were women of color, with many already having had at least one child.",
            "“Honestly, a lot of it’s going to depend on how successful women are going to be getting abortions and how many of them will be having children,” she said.",
            "“We do know that they’re likely going to be low-income children that are going to be covered by Medicaid. And Medicaid pays for a broad range of services in addition to their health coverage, a wide range of services that are going to be important to them if they have also special health care needs as well,” she said."

            "Texas filed a lawsuit against President Joe Biden’s administration Thursday over its guidance that life- or health-saving abortions must be made available to patients, regardless of a state’s laws on the procedure.",
            "The guidance in question came in a memo this week from the Department of Health and Human Services that reiterated existing guidance dating back to 1986. The guidance requires that all patients receive appropriate medical care and stabilizing treatment in an emergency situation.",
            "Since the fall of Roe v. Wade last month, a number of states have enacted abortion bans, some of which include exceptions for the life and safety of the mother. However, the language in those clauses is often vague and confusing, which creates an incentive for providers not to perform abortions until a patient is moments from death, for fear of losing their license or facing legal repercussions.",
            "The Biden administration’s memo is an attempt to address that, but Texas officials have interpreted it as an effort to “use federal law to transform every emergency room in the country into a walk-in abortion clinic” and to force providers into performing abortions, the lawsuit says.",
            "“This administration has a hard time following the law, and now they are trying to have their appointed bureaucrats mandate that hospitals and emergency medicine physicians perform abortions,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) said in a statement Thursday. “I will ensure that President Biden will be forced to comply with the Supreme Court’s important decision concerning abortion and I will not allow him to undermine and distort existing laws to fit his administration’s unlawful agenda.”",
            "The White House called it “unthinkable” that a state would try and fight this guidance.",
            "“This is yet another example of an extreme and radical Republican elected official,” White house press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement, referring to Paxton. “It is unthinkable that this public official would sue to block women from receiving life-saving care in emergency rooms, a right protected under U.S. law.”",
            "Texas’ “trigger ban” on abortion is set to go into effect soon, but providers have already ceased offering the procedure because Paxton argued it’s already outlawed by a pre-Roe ban that was never repealed.",
            "The Texas abortion ban does include a clause allowing for life-saving and health-preserving abortions, but it simply calls on providers to use their “reasonable medical judgment” when making those decisions. Since the Supreme Court struck down Roe, providers have spoken up about how murky those situations are, and have warned that patients may die while they wait for legal advice on how to proceed in an emergency.",
            "The United States has the highest maternal mortality rate among developed nations, an issue that disproportionately affects people of color. In the U.S., Black women are over three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications than white women."

            "A lawsuit has been filed against Uber by multiple women who allege that they were sexually assaulted by the ride-hailing company’s drivers while the company ignored passenger safety in favor of profit and corporate growth.",
            "The lawsuit filed Wednesday in San Francisco County Superior Court claims the women “were kidnapped, sexually assaulted, sexually battered, raped, falsely imprisoned, stalked, harassed, and/or otherwise attacked” while being transported by an Uber driver.",
            "The lawsuit details the accounts of five alleged victims who are named as plaintiffs in the case. The law firm Slater Slater Schulman LLP, which is representing the women, states that it has approximately 550 clients with claims against Uber, with at least 150 more being actively investigated, though they are not plaintiffs in this case.",
            "The transportation company has known about the incidents since at least 2014 but it has failed to take adequate safety actions, the complaint alleges. The most recent alleged incident of sexual assault cited in the complaint occurred early last month. None of the alleged victims are named.",
            "“There is so much more that Uber can be doing to protect riders: adding cameras to deter assaults, performing more robust background checks on drivers, creating a warning system when drivers don’t stay on a path to a destination,” attorney Adam Slater, whose law firm is representing the alleged victims, said in a statement.",
            "Uber, responding to the 49-page lawsuit, said it takes every report of sexual assault seriously.",
            "“While we can’t comment on pending litigation, we will continue to keep safety at the heart of our work,” the company said in a statement to HuffPost on Thursday.",
            "The lawsuit accuses the San Francisco-based company of being “slow and inadequate” in its handling of the incidents and partially blames “toxic-male culture at Uber” for fueling the sexual attacks, saying the company places “profits and growth over safety above all else.”",
            "It further accuses the company of committing unethical practices, including improperly pocketing a $1 “Safe Rides Fee” that it imposed on riders in 2014. Instead of using this money to improve passenger safety, it raked in hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue, as was first reported by The New York Times in 2019, leading to lawsuits.",
            "Uber last month revealed in a U.S. Safety Report that the company received 3,824 reports of sexual assault and misconduct involving passengers in 2019 and 2020. It said the rate of sexual assault reported on the Uber app had decreased by 38% since its last 2019 safety report that covered the years 2017 and 2018. The company also noted that rides decreased as much as 80% around the start of the coronavirus pandemic, though it’s unclear what impact this may have had on that rate of reporting.",
            "The company said it has implemented a host of safety measures for passengers in recent years, including direct access to 911 through its app, a GPS tracker that notifies the company if a trip goes unusually off-course or if a possible crash has occurred, and the ability for passengers to share real-time details about their ride and arrival with others.",
            "All potential drivers are also required to undergo a background check, though the lawsuit filed Wednesday requests that drivers undergo a more extensive biometric background check, with drivers’ fingerprints taken. It argues that this could correct “false negatives” that arise in ordinary name-based background checks.",
            "Uber, founded in 2009, has long faced complaints of misconduct among its corporate staff and drivers.",
            "Earlier this week, The Guardian published internal Uber memos and communications it obtained; they documented law breaking, international lobbying, and the exploitation of driver safety between 2013 and 2017.",
            "In 2017, company co-founder Travis Kalanick resigned following growing ethics complaints and lawsuits, including allegations that he ignored sexual harassment complaints. He resigned from Uber’s board in 2019 after selling off his more than $2.5 billion worth of shares in the company.",
            "“We have not and will not make excuses for past behaviour that is clearly not in line with our present values,” the company said in a statement to The Guardian in response to the internal documents being published. “Instead, we ask the public to judge us by what we’ve done over the last five years and what we will do in the years to come.”",
            "CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated that there were over 500 plaintiffs in this case. The plaintiffs’ law firm has said that it is representing approximately 550 clients with claims against Uber, with cases yet to be filed. The number of plaintiffs in the suit filed Wednesday is five."

            "CNN first reported Wednesday that Trump called the support staffer — whose position had not been identified — shortly after Hutchinson, an assistant to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, testified publicly before the committee. The support staff member didn’t regularly communicate with the president while Trump was in office, and so the staffer was concerned about the call, CNN added.",

            "In the weeks since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, pharmacies across the country have refused to fill certain prescriptions that are the same as or similar to the drugs used in medication abortion. But many of these drugs are used for miscarriage care and ectopic pregnancies, as well as for unrelated health issues like arthritis and stomach ulcers.",
            "The Department of Health and Human Services issued a memo on Wednesday in which it reminded pharmacists at the 60,000 pharmacies that receive federal dollars that they are obligated under federal civil rights law to ensure access to comprehensive reproductive health care services and administer prescribed medication — regardless of whether the recipient is pregnant or able to get pregnant.",
            "The HHS guidance points to several sections of the Affordable Care Act that ensure pharmacies cannot discriminate against customers “with regard to supplying medications; making determinations regarding the suitability of a prescribed medication for a patient; or advising patients about medications and how to take them.”",
            "Medication abortion is made up of two types of drugs: mifepristone and misoprostol. When used together, these drugs are commonly used for miscarriage care and abortion care before the 12 weeks of pregnancy.",
            "The department was prompted to underline its existing guidance on these drugs because there have been dozens of reports of people being denied them due to confusion since Roe was repealed, according to a senior HHS official. This has even been reported in states where medication abortion is legal or in cases where the medication was being used to save the life of the pregnant person. Some women have also reported pharmacists refusing to fill prescriptions for certain forms of mifepristone even though it was prescribed prior to an IUD insertion.",
            "But drugs similar to mifepristone and misoprostol, or other reproductive health care prescriptions like birth control or emergency contraception, have also been caught up in the confusion of a post-Roe world. Heartburn medication has been pulled in some Texas pharmacies because its makeup is similar to that of abortion medications. Some doctors reportedly stopped prescribing methotrexate, a common medication for people with auto-immune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease. Other patients have been wrongly denied their birth control prescriptions or access to emergency contraceptives like Plan B, which are still legal despite the repeal of Roe.",
            "“We are committed to ensuring that everyone can access health care, free of discrimination,” said Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra. “This includes access to prescription medications for reproductive health and other types of care.”",
            "If someone believes they have been wrongly denied a prescription, they can file a complaint with HHS on the department’s website. A team will read over the complaint and evaluate whether it warrants opening an investigation.",
            "This is one of several actions HHS and the Biden administration have taken in the past week in response to the fall of Roe. Earlier this week, the administration clarified existing guidance that protects doctors and their clinical judgment when providing abortion care in emergency situations.",
            "And last week, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to address access to abortion in the wake of the repeal of Roe. The administration promised to protect access to medication abortion, contraception and emergency contraceptives like Plan B. Biden also said he’s considering declaring a public health emergency in order to make certain federal resources available, though the administration has said that’s not likely to happen."

            "The tomb ― located in Herefordshire, England ― gets its name from supposed ties to the mythical ruler.",
            "“Like many prehistoric monuments in western England and Wales, this tomb has been linked to King Arthur since before the 13th century,” English Heritage said on its website. “According to legend, it was here that Arthur slew a giant who left the impression of his elbows on one of the stones as he fell.”",
            "The tomb is at least 3,500 years older than the legend of King Arthur, whose stories took place in the 5th and 6th centuries and were first mentioned centuries later. In more modern times, it was believed that the site served as the inspiration for the Stone Table in the C.S. Lewis book, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.",

            "Steven Umberto Angelini, 41, is charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine and oxycodone and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. Angelini, who has worked in the department for 16 years, has been suspended without pay.",
            "In January, Angelini reached out to the president of the Infamous Ryders Motorcycle Club in Maryland and said he could sell him oxycodone pills, according to an FBI affidavit.",
            "“Sell this pinks for some dogs bro if you have any buddy. Trade,” Angelini said in a text while sending four images of the pills, the criminal complaint said.",
            "He wrote that he had “90 of them” and that he could trade for a “half for $8 a piece and some dog,” apparently referring to cocaine.",
            "“Yeah I want them,” the motorcycle club member replied.",
            "“Ok buddy. They’re yours,” Angelini said back, according to an account of the exchange in the affadavit.",
            "Angelini also told this co-conspirator that one of his former suppliers was murdered, and the potential new supplier agreed to give him $100 and cocaine in exchange for the oxycodone, according to an affidavit. Angelini also allegedly offered to give the co-conspirator information on his former supplier’s death in exchange for drugs. He allegedly gave the co-conspirator sensitive law enforcement information on the ongoing homicide case.",
            "“Bro I am calling homicide tomorrow and finding out any info and want that motherfucker caught,” Angelini wrote in a text. “I’m so sad bro, I don’t know what happened. No wonder his phone wasn’t working.”",
            "Months later, on April 8, Angelini and his contact from the motorcycle club began communicating again, according to the affidavit. Angelini allegedly offered to sell the man a ghost gun ― a privately made firearm that does not have a serial number ― in exchange for cash and narcotics. Later that day, he delivered the gun and received the money and drugs.",
            "Also in April, Angelini texted his co-conspirator and offered to buy ammunition and firearm accessories in exchange for cocaine, the affidavit says. Angelini bought a magazine and ammunition for the ghost gun, which he later gave to his co-conspirator in exchange for the cocaine.",
            "A month later, Angelini allegedly notified the co-conspirator that he had more oxycodone pills for sale, and the two men negotiated that the co-conspirator would give Angelini cash and cocaine for the oxycodone.",
            "If convicted, Angelini could face a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison on the drug-related charges. He faces a mandatory minimum of five years and up to life in federal prison on the firearm charge."

            "He also seems to think Trump’s vice president should have been more loyal to the president than to the country.",
            "Speaking on the right-wing Newsmax network on Monday, Navarro ― who was indicted last month for refusing to comply with a subpoena from the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection ― said:",
            "“The reason why I think Pence is guilty of treason, to at least President Trump and perhaps to this country, is that he acted on the basis of a flawed legal opinion concocted by his own general counsel that he did not share with either the president or with the president’s White House legal counsel. Due process plus duty to the commander in chief required you to do that.”",
            "Treason is the only crime specifically defined in the U.S. Constitution. It’s an act of war by an American against the United States or giving aid and comfort to the nation’s enemies.",

            "“So by the time Jan. 6 rolled around, Pence’s actions were kind of baked into the cake based on both traitorous activity with respect to the president and flawed legal opinions,” he said:",
            "Navarro earlier this year also called Pence a “traitor” and compared him to a character in “Julius Caesar.”",
            "“It was a tragedy that Mike Pence decided to be a traitor to the American Caesar of Trump,” he said in March on Newsmax, according to Salon. “I liken it in [my book] to a Shakespearean moment, the ‘Et tu, Brute?’ moment.”",
            "Now Navarro’s taking a step further and accusing Pence of treason ― to Trump and “perhaps” the nation ― left his critics aghast on Twitter:"

            "The incident occurred after Philip Carroll and two of his relatives wandered off-trail for a chance to take better photos.",
            "Paolo Cappelli, president of the Presidio Permanente Vesuvio base on the summit of the 4,000-foot volcano, told NBC News they forged ahead despite warnings.",
            "“This family took another trail, closed to tourists, even if there was a small gate and ‘no access’ signs,” said Cappelli.",
            "On top of neglecting to follow guidelines and scale the volcano with proper safety precautions, Carroll and his relatives didn’t even pay for tickets, which are required to limit the number of hikers on the trail. They took a prohibited path after departing the nearby town of Ottaviano. When they got to the top, Carroll tried taking a selfie — and dropped his phone into the crater.",
            "“He tried to recover it, but slipped and slid a few meters into the crater,” said Cappelli. “He managed to stop his fall, but at that point, he was stuck. He was very lucky. If he kept going, he would have plunged 300 meters into the crater.”",
            "Mount Vesuvius famously erupted in 79 A.D. and left the nearby city of Pompeii covered in 23 feet of ash and debris, according to CNN. While the volcano is still active and the last eruption occurred in 1944, it’s currently in repose and unlikely to erupt anytime soon.",
            "Mount Vesuvius is nonetheless still considered one of the world’s most dangerous volcanoes due to its physical proximity to major towns like Naples, according to The Guardian. A popular tourist destination, the crater is nearly 1,000 feet deep and 1,500 feet wide.",
            "Carroll was rescued by local guides who rappelled into the crater and pulled him to safety with a rope. He suffered minor injuries including cuts and bruises on his arms and back.",
            "The legal ramifications, however, might prove more detrimental. Carroll and his relatives now face criminal charges for invading public land."

            "A staggering 754 TV shows were eligible for Emmys this year (too many of which premiered this spring, shortly before the qualification deadline). It’s hard to even remember what exactly came out in the past year ― no wonder there are shows that didn’t make it onto enough Emmys voters’ screens to get a nod.",
            "For every buzzy show, there are plenty more that got lost amid the avalanche of television at any given moment. We broke down what surprised us from Tuesday morning’s Emmy nominations, and what we wish the Television Academy hadn’t overlooked.",
            "SURPRISE: Elle Fanning and Nicholas Hoult, “The Great”",
            "Huzzah! It seems Emmys voters are finally recognizing the hilariously unhinged leading performances of “The Great.” Elle Fanning (Catherine) and Nicholas Hoult (Peter) scored their first Emmy nominations for outstanding lead actress and actor in a comedy series for their performances in the Hulu show, which is very loosely based on Catherine the Great’s rise to power. The two actors play a royal couple constantly sparring for control over Mother Russia. The fun romp of a series contains oodles of witty banter, glass breaking, a guest appearance by Gillian Anderson, and yes, plenty of horse jokes.",
            "Fanning and Hoult shine in their respective performances as a couple who despise and love one another in equal parts. Fanning is charming as the ambitiously naive Catherine. But Hoult steals every scene with his portrayal of Peter III — a lazy, misogynistic and hedonistic jerk who was Emperor of Russia for six months before Catherine outsmarted him. And although the Emmy nod for Hoult is very well-deserved, we’re still bitter the underrated actor only got a Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Breakout Star for his role in 2013’s “Warm Bodies.” Make up for it, Emmys! — Elyse Wanshel",
            "SNUB: Selena Gomez, “Only Murders in the Building”",
            "While her co-stars Martin Short and Steve Martin scored nominations for Hulu’s true-crime parody series, the Emmys regrettably overlooked Gomez, who shines as the younger member of a mismatched trio of amateur sleuths recording a podcast about a murder in their New York City apartment building. Her deadpan delivery and comic annoyance at her older counterparts are among the most reliably amusing parts of the show.",
            "Gomez, who rose to fame as a singer and Disney Channel star and has since shown a wide range of talents, would have been just the third Latina woman to ever land a nomination in the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy category, following in the footsteps of Rita Moreno and America Ferrera, according to Variety. The second season of “Only Murders in the Building” just premiered, so Emmys voters will have a chance next year to rectify this snub. (Gomez was nominated as one of the producers of the show, making her only the second Latina ever to be nominated for a producing Emmy for a comedy series.) — Marina Fang",
            "SURPRISE: “Inventing Anna”",
            "OK, I pretty much hated this show, so excuse my disdain for it receiving any nominations at all. (Despite my undying love for Julia Garner in “Ozark,” this performance was a no for me.) The Netflix series follows Anna Sorokin (aka Anna Delvey) as she swindles several New Yorkers, banks and hotels out of their money by pretending to be a German heiress. Usually I’d love a scammer TV series, but the execution of “Inventing Anna” was mostly a snoozefest told through the eyes of a journalist who grew to become way too attached to her subject. You’d think a show about swindling people out of their money would get right to the drama, but the long-running episodes took way too long to get to the scamming.",
            "By the end of it all, audiences might be tempted to feel bad for Delvey because of how the series digs into her backstory. Turns out “Inventing Anna” seemingly scammed its way into the hearts of Emmys voters, too. — Erin E. Evans",
            "SNUB: Sadie Sink, “Stranger Things”",
            "It’s telling that after all these years there is still no Emmy category for genre nominees, which says a lot about how voters feel about horror and sci-fi as a whole. But good on them for finding a way to nominate the horror series “Stranger Things” in the drama category for the fourth time in its run.",
            "Still, unlike in the past where series actors Millie Bobby Brown and David Harbour were recognized, Emmys voters totally ignored Sadie Sink’s incredibly nuanced and remarkable portrayal of 15-year-old Max. Never mind the fact that her Big Moment in episode four practically revitalized Kate Bush fans everywhere. Sink’s performance beautifully embodies personal grief and regret — while having the literal fate of the world on her shoulders.",
            "That deserves to be at least recognized among the Emmy nominees. Because what makes “Stranger Things” so great isn’t just the amazing effects and direction. It also has heart. And in its fourth season, Sink provides that heart. — Candice Frederick",
            "SURPRISE: Jodie Comer and Sandra Oh, “Killing Eve”",
            "Look, I love “Killing Eve,” but let’s be real: this spring’s final season (and especially the series finale) was a letdown. So it was surprising to see both leads of the BBC America thriller get nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, an extremely competitive category. Both have been nominated before, and Comer has previously won for her role as assassin Villanelle.",
            "Meanwhile, the legendary Oh has somehow never won an Emmy in all her years on TV (yes, really!). Again, this category is stacked with contenders, with “Yellowjackets” star Melanie Lynskey as the very deserving favorite to win. But maybe it’s time to finally make Oh an Emmy winner, even if it is for a lesser season of “Killing Eve.” — Marina Fang",
            "SNUB: Mandy Moore, “This Is Us”",
            "As matriarch Rebecca Pearson, Mandy Moore has long been the emotional anchor of NBC’s epic family drama, “This Is Us,” which aired its final season this spring. She is the only member of the show’s sprawling cast to have the difficult feat of portraying her character in three (!) different timelines, including spending hours in the makeup chair to play older Rebecca.",
            "Much of this last season was about Rebecca grappling with a diagnosis of dementia and its effects on the whole Pearson family. Season after season, Moore has delivered incredible and emotionally devastating work, and it’s a shame Emmys voters missed their last chance to honor her performance. — Marina Fang",
            "SURPRISE: Reese Witherspoon, “The Morning Show”",
            "The Emmys loooove “The Morning Show,” Apple TV+’s flagship drama about a fictional network morning news show, that’s packed with big names. I was expecting Jennifer Aniston to land a repeat nomination, but her co-star Reese Witherspoon was a surprise. I actually liked parts of the show’s first season, especially several of its performances. But even I could not defend its trainwreck of a second season, set in the early months of 2020, right before you-know-what. Everything was way too heavy-handed, and I found myself laughing for all the wrong reasons. It was a hot mess (and yet I powered through every episode). — Marina Fang",
            "SNUB: “Pachinko”",
            "The exquisitely crafted Apple TV+ adaptation of Min Jin Lee’s epic novel “Pachinko” was completely shut out of the drama categories, as I feared that it would be because it premiered during an avalanche of shows this spring. Created by veteran TV writer Soo Hugh, the show should have gotten recognized for its staggering scale, following multiple generations of a Korean family in Japan over nearly eight decades, dealing with the repercussions of imperialism and intergenerational trauma. It’s gripping and visually stunning, and it’s chock-full of moving performances from a multigenerational and international cast.",
            "At the very least, it would have been great to see acting nominations for Minha Kim and Oscar winner Yuh-jung Youn, who play the young and old versions, respectively, of the family’s matriarch Sunja. “Pachinko” has been renewed for more seasons, so here’s hoping the Television Academy amends this massive snub in future years. — Marina Fang",
            "SURPRISE: Janelle James, Sheryl Lee Ralph and Tyler James Williams for “Abbott Elementary”",
            "It’s not that they don’t each deserve these nominations. Janelle James, Sheryl Lee Ralph and Tyler James Williams are all absolutely hysterical on the mockumentary series “Abbott Elementary.” It’s just that the Emmys has often recognized only one Black actor per show at a time (see the Emmy history of “Insecure,” for example).",
            "This is James’ first recurring role on a live action series and she hits it square out of the park as Ava, a totally unqualified and unbothered elementary school principal. Meanwhile, Williams is firing from all cylinders as a substitute-turned-staff teacher who gives the single best “are you seeing this bullshit?” camera glances of all the actors on the show.",
            "And can you believe this is Ralph’s first-ever Emmy nomination? The iconic actor, who dazzled us on hits like “Moesha” and “Designing Women” in the ’90s? She finally gets her flowers as a teacher who’s been in the game for a while and may or may not be borrowing some tips on digital learning from her less experienced colleagues. The Emmys said yes to all of these performances, and they should have. — Candice Frederick",
            "SNUB: Pamela Adlon and “Better Things”",
            "It’s absolutely wild that even after its superb final season, “Better Things” has been overlooked yet again by Emmys voters — and won’t get another opportunity to even be in the running. It’s also outrageous that throughout its nearly impeccable five seasons on air, the voting committee only ever recognized Pamela Adlon, the show’s resilient co-creator/star/director/writer, in 2017 and 2018. The Emmys never gave a nod to anything else about this show, which is truly special. Because it’s not just a series about a single mom struggling to manage her three precocious children (goodness knows we’ve seen that premise before). Rather, “Better Things” is a show that, above all, celebrates the small, seemingly insignificant moments throughout motherhood and adolescence — both good and bad — that remind us that we still have a pulse.",
            "The half-hour episodes didn’t have traditional plots that began with a conflict and ended with a solution. Instead, Adlon guided her audience as these characters moved through their lives — from gender identity and unwanted pregnancies to asking yourself who you are besides being a mom. And “Better Things” managed to make us laugh and/or cry while doing all this! Alas, maybe the show is just ahead of its time. If so, Emmys voters will kick themselves later. — Candice Frederick",
            "SNUB: “Power Book III: Raising Kanan”",
            "“Power Book III: Raising Kanan” is the third series in the “Power” franchise and boasts the most talented cast of them all. Tony-winning actor Patina Miller leads the cast as Raquel Thomas, the drug-running boss lady and mother to Kanan (Mekai Curtis), who she hopes will one day run the family business in 1990s South Jamaica, Queens. The STARZ drama is a prequel to the original “Power” series, where audiences were first introduced to series villain Kanan (Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson) and crooked cop Jukebox (Anika Noni Rose). The series grapples with violence, love and loss, tense family dynamics and coming of age in New York City. Performances by Hailey Kilgore, London Brown and Malcolm Mays also make this series as riveting as it is anxiety-inducing in the best way. It’s the kind of drama that the Emmys voters too often overlook, but audiences eat up every storyline from week to week. Highly recommend you catch up on Season 1 before the new season begins in August. — Erin E. Evans",
            "SNUB: “Reservation Dogs”",
            "With an all-indigenous cast and writers’ room, the FX comedy series “Reservation Dogs” is a rarity and a true gem. Full of heart, the brilliant first season follows the adventures of a crew of teens on a Native reservation in Oklahoma, from stealing a chip delivery truck, to plotting out how to escape their mundane lives and pursue their big dreams, to grieving the death of another member of their crew. Each of its eight episodes is wonderfully languid and meditative, and the show has really reinvented and reimagined what TV can look like, on many different fronts. Luckily, the show’s second season premieres next month, so Emmys voters better not forget about it again this time next year. — Marina Fang",
            "SURPRISE: Sarah Niles, “Ted Lasso”",
            "One of the best additions to the second season of “Ted Lasso” was Sarah Niles as Dr. Sharon Fieldstone, who helps a therapy-resistant Ted (Jason Sudeikis) finally open up a bit about his demons and traumatic past. A great second season of a show is often about deconstructing what the first season did. Dr. Sharon was so integral in showing the limits of Ted’s sunny optimism. And on a show whose leads are largely white and male, I’m glad to see recognition for one of its few characters of color with an arc. I’ve also long admired Niles’ work on other British shows like “Catastrophe” and “I May Destroy You,” so it’s nice to see her get a bigger spotlight. — Marina Fang",
            "SNUB: Damson Idris, “Snowfall”",
            "I mostly think Damson Idris deserves this nomination for one particular episode: Season 5, Episode 8, which is titled “Celebration.” Jerome (Amin Joseph) and Louie (Angela Lewis) get married and almost everyone eats some chocolate laced with LSD. Idris, who portrays drug kingpin Franklin Saint, seems to have the most dramatic reaction to the acid and it makes for incredible television.",
            "The FX drama has been overdue for recognition; “Snowfall” still hasn’t received a single Emmy nomination. The series’ first two seasons were a gripping portrayal of life in South Central Los Angeles in the 1980s at the start of the crack cocaine epidemic. Michael Hyatt rounds out this stellar cast, who turn out convincing performances in every episode. (We’ll forget about that tiger plotline for now.) — Erin E. Evans"

            "“The banner will fly from Cape May to Brigantine on one of the biggest vacation weekends of the year. It will literally reach *thousands* of beachgoers at the shore, where so many Pennsylvania families go to vacation every year,” he added.",
            "Fetterman also tweeted a photo of the banner:",
            "He wondered in another tweet if Oz could at least see Pennsylvania from his “sprawling mansion” in New Jersey.",
            "Oz also has dual citizenship in the U.S. and Turkey, and voted in the 2018 Turkish election.",
            "The Turkish situation has raised concerns about national security — even from Trump pal and former secretary of state Mike Pompeo. Oz has claimed he would drop his Turkish citizenship if he wins a spot in the Senate (representing Pennsylvania, not New Jersey).",
            "Oz could not be reached for comment."

            "From wine shops to restaurant menus, orange wine is everywhere these days. This style of wine is really fun to taste due to its wide range of flavor profiles, but there’s one slight problem ― a lot of people don’t have a clue what orange wine actually is.",
            "First, let’s clarify an important misunderstanding that comes up all the time, according to wine professionals: Orange wine is absolutely not made from oranges. Like most red wine, white wine and even rosé, orange wine is made by fermenting grape juice.",
            "Here’s everything you need to know about orange wine.",
            "What is orange wine and how is it made?",
            "Remember, despite the name, orange wine is not made with oranges.",
            "“Orange wine, in its simplest form, is a white wine that is made like a red wine,” said Matt Tunstall, co-owner and beverage director at Stems & Skins, a natural wine bar in North Charleston, South Carolina.",
            "This means that white grapes are pressed and remain in contact with their skins while the juice is fermented. Wine made this way is often referred to as skin-contact wine.",
            "The method is different from making white wine, in which the skins are removed prior to fermentation. With orange wine, skin contact brings out the orange-ish colors that the wine is known for. It can also draw out tannins, which are naturally occurring compounds that can taste bitter or astringent and may leave your mouth feeling dry.",
            "“While the general definition of orange wine is having some skin contact, the way in which it is done varies greatly,” said Holly Berrigan, founder of MYSA Natural Wine.",
            "What does orange wine taste like?",
            "Orange wine can taste really different from one kind to the next. “You can’t blanket all orange wines with similar tasting notes, but you can see, smell and taste the difference between orange wine and white wines produced without the introduction of the skins,” Tunstall said.",
            "Some orange wines taste somewhat like a white wine, while others have an intense, nutty and oxidative flavor, similar in style to sherry, Berrigan said.",
            "“Typically, you will find them somewhere in between, where you’ll experience either a little bit of tannin (drying in the sides of your mouth), or phenolic bitterness (astringency in the mouth) as well as new fruits and flavors you might have missed without the skin contact,” she explained.",
            "Notes of orange are pretty common, and can range from a light tangerine to a deep blood orange, Berrigan said. One reason for the huge range in flavor of different orange wines is that there’s a lot of variation in how they’re made — sometimes winemakers allow skin contact for just a few hours, but it can also happen for months.",
            "And in turn, this means orange wine can be produced in various shades and depths of color, as seen here:",
            "Is orange wine new on the wine scene?",
            "You may have only come across orange wine in recent years, but this style of wine is nothing new. In fact, it’s been around for thousands of years and originated in the country of Georgia.",
            "“The first wines ever made would have been red wines and orange wines,” Berrigan said. “White wines are actually the new kids on the block in overall wine history, only coming on the scene 4,000 years ago vs. 8,000 years ago for red and orange.”",
            "If you want to try orange wine but aren’t sure where to start or what to select, here are some tips to keep in mind.",
            "Ask for help",
            "Don’t be shy about asking a sommelier or store clerk about the wines they have available. This will help you get an idea of the wine’s flavor and texture before buying, Tunstall said. And if you’re at a restaurant or bar, definitely ask for a taste before ordering a glass.",
            "Start simple",
            "Julie Buckner Lane, managing partner at Bar & Garden Dallas, a shop that specializes in natural and organic wine, recommends starting out with some of the more aromatic varietals, like sauvignon blanc, riesling and muscat.",
            "“The aromatics help to soften some of the more bitter and tannic qualities sometimes found in orange/amber wines,” she said.",
            "She also suggests trying natural wine alongside food. “Food is the great equalizer when trying new styles of wines as it can bring balance,” she said.",
            "Think about what you like in the wines you know",
            "“If you are a white wine drinker that’s not that into red or tannin, you should start with something light and easy without too much skin contact or aging,” Berrigan said. “If you’re a bold red drinker who is not into white wine, you might be happier initially with a wine with more time on the skins.”"

            "In the series, Argyle slings pies for the fictional pizza joint and borrows his company van for a multi-state road trip to rescue Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) with his new buddies Jonathan Byers (Charlie Heaton), Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) and Mike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhard).",
            "Some fans noticed a phone number on the side of the van, which was featured heavily in the series, and decided to give it a call.",

            "HuffPost can verify that if one calls 805-45-PIZZA (805-457-4992) Argyle does indeed “pick up,” and says:",
            "“Surfer Boy Pizza, this is Argyle speaking. We make everything fresh here at Surfer Boy, except for our pineapple, which comes from a can, but I still recommend slapping some juicy pineapple on.”",
            "If you’re hesitant to try the pineapple, he has a word of encouragement, saying, “Oh, fruit on your pizza is gnarly, you say? Well, I say try before you deny.”",
            "The greeting is a nod to a line Argyle makes in the show while working at the pizza shop. He also makes the sweet and savory delight for Eleven and her pals before she plunges into a “tub with a bunch of salt” so she “can enhance her psychic powers so she can save the world from this super bad dude,” in his words.",

            "Eddie Munson (Joseph Quinn), another new fan-favorite character from Season 4, unfortunately is not featured in the message.",

            "WIMBLEDON, England (AP) — Novak Djokovic waited. He waited for Nick Kyrgios to lose focus and lose his way. Waited to find the proper read on his foe’s big serves. Waited until his own level rose to the occasion.",
            "Djokovic is not bothered by a deficit — in a game, a set, a match. He does not mind problem-solving. And at Wimbledon, for quite some time now, he does not get defeated.",
            "Djokovic used his steady brilliance to beat the ace-delivering, trick-shot-hitting, constantly chattering Kyrgios 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (3) on Sunday for a fourth consecutive championship at the All England Club and seventh overall.",
            "“Every single time, it gets more and more meaningful and special,” the top-seeded Djokovic said. “It always has been, and will be, the most special tournament in my heart. The one that motivated me and inspired me to start playing tennis in a small little mountain resort in Serbia.”",
            "He extended his unbeaten run at the grass-court Grand Slam tournament to 28 matches and raised his career haul to 21 major trophies, breaking a tie with Roger Federer and moving just one behind Rafael Nadal’s 22 for the most in the history of men’s tennis.",
            "Among men, only Federer, with eight, has won more titles at Wimbledon than Djokovic. In the professional era, only Federer was older (by less than a year) than the 35-year-old Djokovic when winning at the All England Club.",
            "This comeback on a sun-filled afternoon followed those in the quarterfinals, when Djokovic erased a two-set deficit against No. 10 seed Jannik Sinner, and in the semifinals, when No. 9 Cam Norrie grabbed the opening set. In last year’s title match at Wimbledon, Djokovic dropped the opening set. In the 2019 final, he erased two championship points against Federer.",
            "Kyrgios was terrific at the start Sunday, almost perfect in the first set, with 11 aces before he made a second unforced error. Could it last, though?",
            "There were two particularly key moments, ones that Kyrgios would not let go as he began engaging in running monologues, shouting at himself or his entourage (which does not include a full-time coach), earning a warning for cursing, finding reason to disagree with the chair umpire he fist-bumped before the match, and chucking a water bottle.",
            "In the second set, with Djokovic serving at 5-3, Kyrgios got to love-40 — a trio of break points. But Kyrgios played a couple of casual returns, and Djokovic eventually held.",
            "When that set ended, Kyrgios waved dismissively toward his box, sat down and dropped his racket to the turf, then groused, to no one in particular: “It was love-40! Can it get any bigger or what?! Is that big enough for you?!”",
            "And then, in the third set, with Kyrgios serving at 4-all, 40-love, he again let a seemingly sealed game get away, with Djokovic breaking there.",
            "The 40th-ranked Kyrgios was trying to become the first unseeded men’s champion at Wimbledon since Goran Ivanisevic in 2001. Ivanisevic is now Djokovic’s coach and was in the Centre Court guest box for the match.",
            "Kyrgios, the 27-year-old Australian, had never had been past the quarterfinals in 29 previous Grand Slam appearances — and the last time he made it even that far was 7 1/2 years ago.",
            "Still, his talent is unmistakable. But over the years, Kyrgios has drawn more notice for his preference for style over substance on court, his tempestuousness that has earned him ejections and suspensions and his taste for the nightlife.",
            "During the past two weeks alone, Kyrgios racked up $14,000 in fines — one for spitting at a heckling spectator after a first-round victory, another for cursing during a wildly contentious win against No. 4 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in the third round — and caught flack for wearing a red hat and sneakers before or after matches at a place where all-white clothing is mandated. Word also emerged that he is due in court in Australia to face an assault allegation.",
            "On Sunday, Kyrgios tried shots between his legs, hit some with his back to the net, pounded serves at up to 136 mph and produced 30 aces. He used an underarm serve, then faked one later.",
            "For all of the significant records and other factoids logged in the 560-page Wimbledon Compendium — including categories such as “ambidextrous players” or “runners-up who wore glasses in a final” — no mention is made of “underarm serves in a gentleman’s final,” but it seems safe to say that was a first.",
            "Perhaps, in some ways, it would have been fitting for such a unique player to emerge as the champion at such a unique Wimbledon.",
            "All players representing Russia or Belarus were banned by the All England Club because of the war in Ukraine; among the men that kept out of the field were No. 1-ranked Daniil Medvedev, the reigning U.S. Open champion, and No. 8 Andrey Rublev. In response, the WTA and ATP professional tennis tours took the unprecedented step of revoking all ranking points from Wimbledon.",
            "A woman who was born in Russia but has represented Kazakhstan for four years, Elena Rybakina, won the women’s trophy Saturday with a 3-6, 6-2, 6-2 victory over Ons Jabeur. It was the first Wimbledon title match since 1962 between two women making their Grand Slam final debuts, and Rybakina, at No. 23, is the second-lowest female champion at the All England Club since WTA computerized rankings began in 1975.",
            "There’s more: Federer missed the tournament for the first time since the late 1990s because he is still recovering from a series of operations on his right knee. The No. 2 man in the rankings, Alexander Zverev, sat out after tearing ankle ligaments at the French Open. Three of the top 20 seeded men, including 2021 runner-up Matteo Berrettini, pulled out of Wimbledon after it began because they tested positive for COVID-19.",
            "And Nadal withdrew before he was supposed to face Kyrgios in the semifinals, the first time since 1931 that a man gave walkover at Wimbledon in a semifinal or final.",
            "Djokovic and Kyrgios have not always gotten along.",
            "Kyrgios was quite critical of Djokovic publicly until he became one of the earliest voices backing the Serbian during the legal saga that played out before the Australian Open in January, culminating in Djokovic being deported from that country because he is not vaccinated against COVID-19 (which also might prevent him from participating in the U.S. Open in August).",
            "That apparently helped create a détente of sorts; Kyrgios used the term “bromance” to describe their relationship status. They kidded around via social media on Saturday, trading messages about heading for drinks or dinner, with the winner footing the bill.",
            "“He’s a bit of a god, I’m not going to lie,” Kyrgios said during the trophy ceremony. “I thought I played well. You’ve won the championship I don’t even know how many times.”",

            "For years, millennial and Gen Z girls eagerly awaited the catalogs, circling every product imaginable for holiday and birthday wish lists. The now cringey “The Care & Keeping of You” book series educated us on health, well-being and puberty. The “Just Like Me” — now “Truly Me” dolls — influenced our own lives, looks and personalities. And then Addy Walker, a young girl enslaved on a North Carolina plantation, was the first Black doll ― and the sole one for decades.",
            "These are the mostly fond memories of an iconic doll brand: American Girl. The brand, created by writer and philanthropist Pleasant Rowland in 1986, is a line of 18-inch dolls and 15-inch Bitty Babies who portray American youth, predominantly young girls, from different times in history. From Victorian-era trust-fund child Samantha Parkington to their first Asian American “Girl of the Year” doll, Jessica, the $115 dolls come with their own worlds, replete with books, clothes, furniture, video games and occasional movie deals.",
            "The brand, now owned by Mattel, has not only expanded over the years but also has continued to be a mainstay in the memories of middle-class American girls’ childhoods. Gone are the days of us begging our parents for tickets to the premiere of the 2008 film “Kitt Kittredge: An American Girl” or pleading for more time to play Josefina Montova’s game on the American Girl website.",
            "Instead, in the last year— from Ziwe Fumudoh’s late-night skits about the dolls to TikTok influencers dining at the American Girl doll cafe — the AG franchise has reentered the zeitgeist in a whole new way. Millennials and Gen Z women who have grown out of their doll phase have found community in the meme pages taking over Instagram and Twitter. The dolls have become a rallying cry, both for the nostalgia of our childhoods and as a protest against the series of unfortunate historical events we’ve been living through.",
            "These pages — whose account names are often spoofs of doll names, such as @cottagecorekirsten (named for 1854 doll Kirsten Larson) and @juuliealbright (named for 1970s doll Julie Albright) — post content that rate the dolls’ outfits, gauge which American Girl doll would be most likely to do certain things and, most important, have given rise to the “We Need an American Girl Doll” meme format.",
            "Barrett Adair, 27, and her best friend, “C,” who asked not to be identified by name because she prefers to keep a lower profile, are the co-creators of the page @hellicity_merriman, a riff of the 1770s Colonial-era doll, Felicity Merriman.",
            "The “Hellicity Merriman” Instagram page has gained 159,000 followers since it launched in February. Adair works in political digital strategy in Washington, D.C., by day and is a burgeoning meme lord by night. Adair said that American Girl was crucial to the development of her friendship with C five years ago. As they both started a new job for a political campaign, they started taking online quizzes in their downtime.",
            "“One of the funniest ones that we did is we all took a BuzzFeed quiz on what American Girl doll we would be,” Adair said with a laugh. “Then from there, we had to read the Betches article of ‘American Girl Dolls Ranked by Betchiness,’” Adair said. “From that moment on, it was just something that she and I really bonded over. We made every new friend take this quiz; we’ve made the guys we date take this quiz. Our friendship was this shared knowledge of the brand and the characters.”",
            "In 2021, the friends noticed the memes sprawling across social media. That’s when C proposed the idea of creating a page of their own. What was once all fun and games has now generated an unexpected cult following.",
            "“It got picked up in a TikTok that went viral a couple of weeks ago,” Adair said. “So we had hit about 10,000 followers in a steady, pretty organic way. Then that TikTok was published, and it’s just been a snowball effect.”",
            "Adair recalled that upon the reversal of Roe v. Wade, followers said that they initially learned the news from Hellicity Merriman. In protests following the ruling overturning abortion rights, the “We Need an American Girl Doll” meme was seen on posters across Washington, D.C. The same phenomenon occurred days ago, after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s resignation and a timely post from the account. One Instagram user, @alexandra.p.g., commented, “WHAT happened in British parliament?” followed by “I cannot believe I’m getting my news from an American girl satire page.”",
            "Felicity Merriman was not Adair’s favorite doll; rather, Samantha, whom Adair described as the quintessential “girlie girl,” stole her heart. Raised by her grandmother in the fictional Mount Bedford, New York, the 1904 Victorian character was an orphan who, although raised in wealth, has no airs about her. After reading the doll’s themed novel “Happy Birthday, Samantha,” 6-year-old Adair had an epiphany.",
            "“I read her birthday book, and Samantha did not have a birthday cake for her 10th birthday party. She had had petit fours,” recalled Adair. “I’m 6. I go up to my mother, it’s my birthday. And I’m like, Mom, I insist on serving petit fours to my guests. My mother, the saint that she was, unflinchingly was like, ‘Yeah, OK.’ And made them from scratch. I have tried to do that as an adult, and absolutely fucking not.”",
            "She said that the allure of the American Girl Doll brand lies in its hyper-specificity and character-building in comparison to other doll brands. While Barbie played on imagination, American Girl dolls were defined characters with stories outlining their flaws and struggles, from Kit Kittredge’s nosiness to Julie Albright grappling with adjusting to her parents’ divorce. Adair noted that there is space for multiplicity — the glitz, glamor and extravagance of Barbie coupled with empowerment and education — but the key to American Girl’s longevity is relatability.",
            "American Girl is “intensely focused on making a product that is fun to play with but also seemingly building allure around it that is not focused on perfection, idealism and romanticism but rather, to some extent, history, education, imperfection and pure girlhood,” Adair said. “Every girl’s story has some example of some way they did something bad to a friend or family member, but they were humbled in some way. They had to be taught how to do something the right way, grow and change, and they have talents and strengths. As adults, we can still kind of relate to it because we know these girls’ personalities. We relate to having moments of growth and self-reflection, still.”",
            "HuffPost reached out to American Girl for comment regarding the recent emergence of doll-related meme accounts.",
            "“Nostalgia continues to be part of the zeitgeist right now and is driving many of the recent social trends sparked by avid American Girl fans,” Jamie Cygielman, general manager of American Girl, said in a statement. “We also know it’s fun to be reminded of our favorite childhood memories, so we aren’t surprised when our fans — many of whom grew up with us and are now parents themselves — continue to bring American Girl into the cultural conversation.",
            "“This recent trend reminds us of the important role American Girl has played in people’s childhoods and shows that we still hold a special place in the hearts of so many.”",
            "For Lydia B., creator and page manager of @Klit.Klittredge, her favorite doll was none other than Kit Kittredge, an aspiring 10-year-old journalist during the Great Depression.",
            "“She’s the best. Her telling her grandfather that she doesn’t want to live with him, she supported FDR — what a queen!” said Lydia, who works in policy in D.C. and requested HuffPost not use her last name to protect her privacy. “I don’t think it’s that crazy either to think that a girl who was really into journalism, especially with the newly introduced fireside chats at the time, knows about the president.”",
            "Lydia, a 24-year-old who self-describes as “chronically online,” has been posting memes on the internet since age 11, running countless meme accounts over the years. However, none of them have been as successful as Klit Klittredge, which has more than 30,000 followers on Instagram and 46,000 on Twitter. She posted her first American Doll meme in August 2021 after noticing people were talking about the dolls earlier that summer.",
            "“I made a TikTok once that compared American Girl dolls as being a gateway drug to being a radical leftist. That TikTok did really well and actually, the audio got banned because it talked about doing heroin,” Lydia said. “So, that TikTok was only up for about eight hours but got around 30,000 likes. I guess I just woke up one day with the name Klit Klittredge in my head, and I started the account.”",
            "For Lydia, the dolls were a staple of her childhood; she went to sleepovers and birthday parties with the dolls in tow. Her first meme that went viral was in September, when Lydia made a fake infographic from the perspective of the American Girl brand about abortion.",
            "The punchline featured a picture of ’70s-era doll Julie Albright saying “Yeetus that Fetus.” Lydia said that it’s not a coincidence that American Girl dolls have made their comeback during our continuous stream of living through “unprecedented” events.",
            "“The whole gimmick of American Girl is you pick a girl, and she’s living through a historical time period where something important is happening. You create a doll that represents a girl from that era,” Lydia said. “The 2020s feels like a historical era; it feels like we’re living through something big. I think a lot of people are latching on to the idea of what an American Girl who lives in 2020 might be or look like.”",
            "Hailing from central Kentucky, Lydia said members of her Southern Baptist churchgoing community got swept up in the middle-class Americana branding of the franchise. Though the dolls have mobilized a generation of bold, young women speaking up for what they believe in, Lydia said that American Girl as a corporation was merely making money off of a demographic, not inherently having complex conversations regarding diversity, identity or progressive politics.",
            "She said that as the meme pages come into the conversation and appeal to a now-adult base, we’re having more complex conversations about what it meant to have an American Girl doll as a child and what it means to be an American girl today.",
            "“I don’t really think that American Girl as a corporation is going to be the entity that defines what it means to be an American girl,” Lydia said. “I don’t have a lot of faith that they’re going to get with it.”",
            "In 2005, American Girl launched its “I Can” campaign to support the nonprofit Girls Inc., which aimed to inspire girls “to be strong, smart and bold.” According to The New York Times and CBS News, conservative family groups threatened to boycott the brand, claiming it was aiding an organization that supported abortion rights. Lydia’s church participated in the boycott. However, Lydia’s mom still supported the brand, only furthering her daughter’s doll obsession.",
            "“Learning about Addy, Josefina and Kaya, I didn’t really learn that in school,” Lydia said. “There’s one of Addy’s books where she’s talking about going to school, and she doesn’t like the white girls in her class. I remember reading that at like 8 or 9, as a white girl who knew of Black girls in school but didn’t have any Black friends. I was thinking, ‘What do the Black girls at my school think of me and why?’ While she was enslaved, they were pushing some barriers.”",
            "Living in D.C., Lydia attended protests when news leaked in early May of the pending Supreme Court ruling on abortion. She turned one of her memes into a poster, and women of all ages came up to her, asking to take a picture of her sign, she said.",
            "On April Fools’ Day, Lydia posted a fake American Girl press release from the Klit Klittredge account. One of the lines eloquently read, “We know that American girls grow into American teens, but we know the values — social issues, identity, and activism — that young people learn from their American Girl dolls last a lifetime.”",
            "“I meant that as I wrote it, and I believe it to be true about my account as well,” Lydia said. “That we hold these values and it changes as we get older. We have a more complex understanding of these values and what they mean for us in our country and, and what it means to be an American girl.”",
            "Adair credits the resurgence of American Girl to good timing. She describes Hellicity Merriman’s audience as “the girls,” not specific to gender but rather “anyone, like with the energy of a capital G girl.” Following the Roe v. Wade ruling, now more than ever, people are confronting what it means to be an American Girl, Adair said.",
            "“My friend and I are very political and made the choice really early on — because we didn’t care about growing the account, necessarily — to be as explicitly political as possible on the account and grew an audience that responded well to that,” she said. “I’ve never been more glad to be making something that people like to look at and give people some really apt way to describe how they’re feeling, with a little bit of humor and a little bit of camaraderie with their generation and the generation before them. I’m happy that we have this very appropriately silly little thing to commiserate over together.”",
            "And may the spirit of the dolls live on.",
            "CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article said Corinne Tan was the first Asian American “Girl of the Year” doll. While Corinne was the first “Girl of the Year” of Chinese descent, Jessica has the distinction of being the first Asian American one."

            "Police say they are investigating reports that a group of men arrived in a minibus taxi and opened fire on some of the patrons at the bar shortly after midnight Sunday.",
            "Those injured have been taken to Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital.",
            "The number of cartridges found on the scene indicates that a group of people opened fire in the bar, said Gauteng province police commissioner Lt. Gen. Elias Mawela.",
            "“The primary investigation suggests that these people were enjoying themselves here, in a licensed tavern operating within the right hours,” Mawela told The Associated Press.",
            "“All of a sudden they heard some gunshots, that is when people tried to run out of the tavern. We don’t have the full details at the moment of what is the motive, and why they were targeting these people,” he said.",
            "“You can see that a high caliber firearm was used and it was shooting randomly. You can see that every one of those people were struggling to get out of the tavern,” Mawela told The Associated Press.",
            "The area where the shooting took place was very dark, making it harder to find people who could identify the suspects, he said.",
            "Rifles and a 9 mm pistol were used in the attack, said national police spokeswoman Col. Dimakatso Sello.",

Police said 8 other people are receiving treatment in a hospital. The deceased were aged between 30 and 45 and police are investigating charges of murder and attempted murder, police said.",

            "“As a nation, we cannot allow violent criminals to terrorize us in this way, regardless of where such incidents may occur,” Ramaphosa said in a statement.",
            "“As government, citizens and structures of civil society we must all work together even more closely to improve social and economic conditions in communities, reduce violent crime and stamp out the illicit circulation of firearms,” he said.",
            "The bar shootings come two weeks after 21 teenagers were found dead in a tavern in the city of East London. The cause of those deaths has not yet been announced by authorities, but the teens were not shot nor crushed in a stampede, according to officials."

            "Former White House strategist Steve Bannon plans to testify before the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) said Sunday, citing a letter the committee received late Saturday from Bannon’s lawyers.",
            "“I expect that we will be hearing from him and there are many questions that we have for him,” Lofgren, who’s on the House committee, told CNN’s “State of the Union.”",
            "Bannon’s deposition is not likely to be broadcast live for the public due to the length of such sessions as the committee tries to get all its questions answered, she added.",
            "Bannon, a longtime ally of former President Donald Trump, had previously refused to appear for a deposition after being subpoenaed by the committee. He was consequently charged in November with two counts of criminal contempt.",
            "His sudden reversal follows Trump reportedly giving Bannon his blessing on Saturday to appear before the committee, with Trump informing Bannon in a letter obtained by CNN and The Washington Post that he would waive his claimed right to executive privilege to allow Bannon to testify.",
            "“When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated, having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President,” Trump reportedly told Bannon.",
            "Trump’s claim of executive privilege has been disputed by government lawyers.",
            "Bannon pleaded not guilty late last year to the two contempt charges, which each carry up to one year in jail and $100,000 in fines. His trial is set to begin on July 18.",

            "Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said in a televised statement Saturday that he informed Rajapaksa of a decision taken at a meeting of Parliamentary party leaders requesting he leave office, and he agreed.",
            "However Rajapaksa will remain as president until Wednesday to ensure a smooth transfer of power, Abeywardena added.",
            "The announcement came hours after protesters stormed the president’s official residence to vent their anger over the country’s severe economic crisis. Protesters also broke into the prime minister’s private residence and set it on fire.",
            "Earlier on Saturday, protesters broke into the Sri Lankan prime minister’s private residence and set it on fire, hours after he said he would resign when a new government is formed, in the biggest day of demonstrations that also saw crowds storming the president’s home and office.",
            "The office of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the protesters forced their way into his Colombo home on Saturday evening. It’s not immediately clear if he was inside at the time of the attack.",
            "Wickremesinghe agreed to resign earlier on Saturday after party leaders in Parliament demanded both he and the embattled president step down on the day protesters stormed the president’s residence and office in a fury over a worsening economic crisis.",
            "Wickremesinghe said in a voice statement that he will resign when all parties have agreed on a new government.",
            "“Today in this country we have a fuel crisis, a food shortage, we have the head of the World Food Program coming here and we have several matters to discuss with the IMF. Therefore, if this government leaves there should be another government,” he said.",
            "His decision came after the biggest protest yet swept Sri Lanka as tens of thousands of people broke through barricades and entered Rajapaksa’s residence and nearby office to vent their anger against a leader they hold responsible for the nation’s worst crisis.",
            "Footage showed people in a jubilant mood taking a dip in the garden pool of the residence. Some lay on beds, others made tea and drank, and made “statements” from the conference room that Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe must immediately quit.",
            "Wickremesinghe said he suggested to the president to have an all-party government, but didn’t say anything about Rajapaksa’s whereabouts. Opposition parties in Parliament were currently discussing the formation of a new government.",
            "Rajapaksa appointed Wickremesinghe as prime minister in May in the hope that the career politician would use his diplomacy and contacts to resuscitate a collapsed economy. But people’s patience wore thin as shortages of fuel, medicine and cooking gas only increased and oil reserves ran dry.",
            "Many protesters accuse Wickremesinghe of trying to save Rajapaksa when he came under pressure to resign and every other member of his powerful political dynasty quit the Cabinet.",
            "Later Saturday evening, protesters moved near Wickremesinghe’s home in a bid to force him to quit immediately.",

            "It was not clear if Rajapaksa was inside his residence when it was stormed earlier Saturday. A government spokesman, Mohan Samaranayake, said he had no information about his movements.",
            "Leaders of political parties in Parliament met later and decided to request Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe to step down, opposition lawmaker Rauff Hakeem said on Twitter. He said a consensus was reached that the parliamentary speaker should take over as temporary president and work on an interim government.",
            "Sri Lanka’s economy is in a state of collapse, relying on aid from India and other countries as its leaders try to negotiate a bailout with the International Monetary Fund. The economic meltdown has led to severe shortages of essential items, leaving people struggling to buy food, fuel and other necessities.The turmoil has led to months of protests, which have nearly dismantled the Rajapaksa political dynasty that has ruled Sri Lanka for most of the past two decades.",
            "The president’s older brother resigned as prime minister in May after violent protests saw him seek safety at a naval base. Much of the public ire has been pointed at the Rajapaksa family, with protesters blaming them for dragging Sri Lanka into chaos with poor management and allegations of corruption.",
            "At the president’s office, security personnel tried to stop demonstrators who pushed through fences to run across the lawns and inside the colonial-era building.",
            "At least 34 people including two police officers were wounded in scuffles as protesters tried to enter the residence. Two of the injured are in critical condition while others sustained minor injuries, said an official at the Colombo National Hospital who spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak to the media.",
            "Thousands of protesters entered the capital from the suburbs after police lifted an overnight curfew. With fuel supplies scarce, many crowded onto buses and trains to come to the city to protest, while others made their way on bicycles and on foot.",
            "Protest and religious leaders called on Rajapaksa to step down, saying he has lost the people’s mandate.",
            "“His claim that he was voted in by the Sinhala Buddhists is not valid now,” said Ven. Omalpe Sobitha, a prominent Buddhist leader. He urged Parliament to convene immediately to select an interim president but said that Wickremesinghe did not enjoy the people’s support.",
            "Last month, Wickremesinghe said the country’s economy has collapsed. He said that the negotiations with the IMF have been complex because Sri Lanka was now a bankrupt state.",

            "Former President Donald Trump is now desperately attempting to snatch Wisconsin from the jaws of his defeat by suddenly claiming he won the state in the 2020 presidential election.",
            "He didn’t.",
            "His reasoning? Since the Wisconsin state Supreme Court issued a ruling Friday sharply curtailing the number of drop boxes for absentee ballots, that must mean all the votes in those boxes in November 2020 were somehow fake — and apparently were all marked for victor Joe Biden.",
            "“This means I won the very closely contested (not actually) Wisconsin Presidential race because they used these corrupt and scandal-ridden Scam Boxes,” he falsely insisted in a post Friday on Truth Social.",
            "There is no evidence that the vote in Wisconsin, or anywhere else in the nation, was fraudulent. Dozens of court cases and several recounts state by state verified Biden’s victory.",
            "Members of Trump’s own Department of Justice found no evidence of fraud after extensive investigations. Trump’s handpicked attorney general, William Barr, called the election fraud claims “bullshit.”",
            "“These allegations were simply not true,” Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general at the time, told Trump, he testified last month before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. He added that Trump eventually said: “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.”",
            "Trump and Republicans have claimed that drop boxes facilitated cheating but have offered no evidence.",
            "The conservative-controlled Wisconsin court ruled that under current law, absentee ballot drop boxes may only be placed in election offices and that no one other than the voter can return a ballot in person. “Ballot drop boxes appear nowhere in the detailed statutory system for absentee voting,” Justice Rebecca Bradley wrote.",
            "There’s no move in Wisconsin to switch Biden’s victory to Trump.",
            "Critics say the GOP goal is to significantly decrease the number of votes, which is generally considered beneficial to Republicans. One way to do that it to make voting as inconvenient as possible.",
            "Trump said on Fox News in 2020 that “you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again” if “voting levels” rose. (Research has shown, however, that mail-in ballots don’t appear to give either party a distinct advantage.)",
            "Trump continues to push for single-day, in-person voting in elections — prohibiting convenient mail-in ballots and early voting that 69% of American voters used in 2020.

            "NEW YORK (AP) — As Donald Trump considers another White House run, polls show he’s the most popular figure in the Republican Party. But it wasn’t always that way.",
            "Competing at one point against a dozen rivals for the presidential nomination in 2016, Trump won only about one-third of the vote in key early states. He even lost in Iowa, which kicks off the nomination process.",
            "But he prevailed because those in the party who opposed his brand of divisive politics were never able to coalesce around a single rival. That same dynamic could repeat itself as Trump mulls a new bid for the presidency as soon as this summer.",
            "With a growing list of candidates gearing up to run, even a Trump diminished by two impeachments and mounting legal vulnerabilities could hold a commanding position in a fractured, multi-candidate primary.",
            "“I fear it could end up the same way as 2016, which basically was everyone thought everyone else should get out,” said Republican strategist Mike DuHaime, who advised former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s campaign that year. “I think every major candidate realized that he or she would have a better shot against Trump one-on-one. But of course each person thought he or she should be the one to get that shot and nobody got out of the way. ... And then it was too late.”",
            "The anxiety is mounting as a growing list of potential rivals take increasingly brazen steps, delivering high-profile speeches, running ads, courting donors and making repeat visits to early voting states.",
            "That group now includes upward of a dozen could-be-candidates, including Trump’s former vice president, Mike Pence; his former secretary of state, Mike Pompeo; and Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Rick Scott of Florida and Tim Scott of South Carolina. All could run on the former president’s policies.",
            "In the anti-Trump lane, politicians such as Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan are raising their profiles.",
            "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is increasingly seen as Trump’s heir apparent, even by Trump’s most loyal supporters, and viewed by Trump allies as his most formidable potential challenger.",
            "Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and others have said they will not challenge Trump if he does go forward. But others, including Christie, seem to be gunning for the fight, even if they seem to be long shots.",
            "“I’m definitely giving it serious thought. I’m not gonna make any decision probably until the end of the year,” Christie said in a recent interview. He has urged the party to move on from Trump and his ongoing obsession with the 2020 election.",
            "“For me, it’s about the party needing to go in in a new direction from a personality perspective, and to continue to have someone who can bring strong leadership, tough leadership, that the country needs, but doesn’t have all of the other drama that goes along with it,” he said. “I’m hearing the same things from donors that I’m hearing from voters — that they’re very concerned that we can’t put ourselves in a position to have 2024 be about anything but the good of the country.”",
            "Pompeo, who has had a busy travel schedule and plans to return to Iowa this summer, said in a recent interview that he has been spending time reading and listening to President Ronald Reagan’s speeches as he prepares for a possible run.",
            "“We’re getting ready to stay in the fight,” he said last month as he courted evangelical Christians at a gathering in Nashville, Tennessee.",
            "He said he and his wife would sit down after the November elections and “think our way through it, pray our way through it, and decide where’s best to serve. It could be presenting ourselves for elected office again. We may choose a different path. But we’re not gonna walk away from these things that I’ve been working on for 30 years now. They matter too much.”",
            "Pompeo sketched out a possible approach in much the same mold as Trump.",
            "“He was a disruptor that was most necessary in 2016, there’s no doubt about that,” Pompeo said. “And now the task is to take those set of understandings, those set of principles, and defend them and build upon them. And it’s gonna take a lot of work to do that, leaders of real fortitude and character to do that.”",
            "Such open talk comes as Trump faces a cascade of escalating legal troubles.",
            "The congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection has revealed increasingly damaging information about Trump’s final weeks in office. The Department of Justice has its own investigation. In Georgia, the prosecutor investigating Trump’s potentially illegal meddling in the state’s 2020 election has stepped up her inquiry by subpoenaing members of Trump’s inner circle. In New York, Trump, his namesake son and his daughter Ivanka have agreed to answer questions under oath beginning next week in the state attorney general’s civil investigation into his business practices.",
            "Mick Mulvaney, a former South Carolina congressman who served as Trump’s acting White House chief of staff, said the moves suggested potential candidates “might see an opening where none existed two months ago.”",
            "“Trump fatigue might be a real thing,” he said, with voters asking themselves whether, if they vote for another candidate, they “can get the same policies without all the baggage.”",
            "At the same time, Trump has seen some of his endorsed primary candidates falter. Those who have won, including Senate hopefuls JD Vance in Ohio and Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania, have done so with about 30% of the vote, meaning that two-thirds of party voters went against Trump’s picks.",
            "“I don’t think anybody underestimates Trump. There’s a reason he’s the most sought-after endorsement in every single Republican primary,” said GOP strategist Alex Conant. “That said, I think there’s a recognition that a lot of Republican voters are looking to the future and ready for what’s next.”",
            "To what extent remains an open question. During a trip to Iowa this week, Cotton declined to weigh in on Trump’s standing. But the senator said he hoped to be “an effective national leader, not only for my party but for the American people in my role in the Senate and any other future role I might serve.”",
            "Still, Cotton argued, candidates should embrace Trump’s legacy.",
            "“I know that Donald Trump is very popular among our voters who appreciate the successes he delivered for four years in a very hostile environment. They don’t want Republicans who are running against that legacy, because they view that legacy as a great success,” he said Thursday in Cambridge, Iowa.",
            "Trump continues to move forward with his own events.",
            "On Friday night, he campaigned in Las Vegas alongside Adam Laxalt, his pick for Nevada Senate. And on Saturday night, he planned a rally in Anchorage, Alaska, to campaign with Kelly Tshibaka, whom he has endorsed in her race against Sen. Lisa Murkowski, and others, including former Gov. Sarah Palin, now running for Congress.",
            "Conant said it made sense for candidates to continue testing the waters for now.",
            "“A lot of potential candidates are realizing that 2024 may be their last best chance, regardless of what Trump does,” he said. “There’s a very vulnerable Democrat in the White House, Republicans seem likely to win, and if it’s not Trump, they’re basically sidelined for the next 10 years.”",
            "Still, Conant, who served as communications director to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio’s 2016 presidential bid, noted the similarities.",
            "“It looks like it’s increasingly clear there’s going to be a lot of people running for president. And while I think there’s an appetite for something different, the alternative to Trump needs to coalesce around one candidate,” he said. “That never happened in 2016. And it might not happen in 2024.”",

            "Heavily armed police officers swarmed former White House strategist Steve Bannon’s Washington home Friday in a so-called “swatting” attack after someone called in a false report of a man with a gun, The Washington Post reported.",
            "The caller said the unidentified man had shot someone, according to the Post.",
            "Police shut down streets to cut off the block where Bannon’s Capitol Hill row house is located, near the U.S. Capitol and the Supreme Court.",
            "The alarm was lifted about an hour after the late-morning call, according to the Post.",
            "A police spokesperson told the newspaper that the phone call appeared to be a “swatting” attack in which a false report triggers a startling law enforcement response.",
            "Bannon told NBC News later as he was reentering his home that the police were “terrific.”",
            "It wasn’t clear whether Bannon was at home when police first arrived, the Post noted.",
            "Jeffery Carroll, an assistant District of Columbia police chief, told reporters that officers walked through Bannon’s home and spoke with those inside to make certain it was safe.",
            "“They were a little bit shocked, but obviously they understood why we were there,” Carroll said.",
            "Bannon, a Donald Trump acolyte who worked for him early in his administration as chief White House strategist, is mostly known now for his role as Capitol riot provocateur and for his incendiary “War Room” podcasts.",
            "He is accused of scheming with other Trump allies to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. He reportedly urged that the Biden presidency be killed “in the crib.”",
            "On his “War Room” podcast the day before the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on Congress, he told his listeners: “All I can say is, strap in …. You made this happen, and tomorrow it’s game day. So strap in. Let’s get ready .... It’s all converging, and now we’re on the point of attack tomorrow.”",
            "Bannon is currently under indictment on two counts of criminal contempt of Congress for ignoring a subpoena from the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol assault. His trial is scheduled to get underway July 18.",
            "Robert Costello, a lawyer for Bannon, is now seeking to end his representation of him, citing the possibility of being called as a witness at the trial, according to a court document on Friday, Reuters reported.",
            "“Since it appears there will be a trial, and since it appears that at this point in time I might be called as a witness, I must reluctantly ask the Court to grant my request” asking to withdraw as trial counsel,Costello wrote in the filing with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.",
            "The Post also reported on Friday that Trump is considering “waiving” executive privilege for Bannon so he can testify before the Jan. 6 panel, according to sources.",
            "Executive privilege is not Trump’s to waive, however, because he is no longer the “executive.” President Joe Biden has already determined that people being investigated in the Jan. 6 insurrection are not shielded by executive privilege.",
            "In addition, crimes are not protected by executive privilege, and Bannon was a private citizen on Jan. 6, 2021."

            "On June 24, mere hours after the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade and upended abortion rights in America, a truck driver sized up a group of protesters crossing the street in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and put his foot on the gas.",
            "The victims — all of them women — were among the last few people in a group of about 100 trying to cross a busy downtown intersection safely via the crosswalk. They described the attack as a slow-motion horror show: A visibly irritated driver maneuvered his truck around the car in front of him and then beelined it through the intersection, directly toward the protesters.",
            "He slowed down as his bumper met with the outstretched arms of the women still in the crosswalk. But he didn’t stop.",
            "“We made eye contact at that point. And I saw hate. Just hate,” said one of the women, who asked to remain anonymous for her safety. She spoke through tears as she continued, “He screamed at me to move, and I remember shouting ‘No,’ and he started driving. And that’s when I knew I was going to get run over.”",
            "The driver — whose identity police haven’t made public — pushed forward, bowling the women over before he left the scene, witnesses said. Several were hospitalized, including one woman who suffered a concussion and another whose ankle had been rolled over.",
            "Multiple high-profile members of the community attended the march and witnessed the attack, including a local bartender, a city councilwoman, a county prosecutor (who had his wife and two young daughters in tow), and a journalist. Initially, witnesses thought they might have an open-and-shut case in front of them: They had witness statements from community leaders, footage of the incident from multiple angles, and they all saw the same thing.",
            "But in the hours and days that followed, they learned the same harsh lesson that many other communities had learned in the previous few years: The system was set up to support the driver in this situation, not the protesters they hit.",
            "In 2021, Iowa Republicans passed a bill that effectively eliminated civil liability for drivers who hit protesters in the street, and increased various penalties for protesters. The bill was championed by Gov. Kim Reynolds, whose own SUV driver struck a Black Lives Matter protester in the heat of the 2020 demonstrations (state police blamed the protester). While it remains to be seen how those laws might affect the case in Cedar Rapids, two women who’d been hit by the truck wondered aloud in interviews with HuffPost whether they might face charges instead of the driver.",
            "It’s unclear whether charges will be filed at all. Cedar Rapids police made contact with the driver the day of the attack, but declined to press charges at the time, a department spokesman confirmed. The county attorney, Nick Maybanks, saw the entire incident, but he told HuffPost that his new role as a case witness meant he had to recuse himself as prosecutor. (He forwarded the case to Black Hawk County Attorney Brian Williams, who said his office hadn’t gone through any evidence yet, let alone made any charging decisions.)",
            "The sobering reality now coming into focus is that the attack on this community isn’t particularly unique or surprising. Taken alongside recent incidents of political violence across America, the Cedar Rapids attack is an almost insignificant data point on a densely packed timeline.",
            "In fact, vehicular assaults against protesters amount to a crisis in their own right. Incidents have skyrocketed since the summer of 2020, when millions of protesters took the streets to demonstrate against police violence and bigotry following the murder of George Floyd by an officer in May. Data collected by The Washington Post proved that those protests were overwhelmingly peaceful — no injuries or property damage were reported in more than 96% of events — and yet protesters across the country were met with vitriol, authoritarian crackdowns and physical violence from then-President Donald Trump and his administration.",
            "Trump called them “vicious dogs” and “thugs,” and deployed federal troops to events, where they attacked protesters and disappeared them in unmarked vans. Fox News, meanwhile, was churning out disinformation and lies surrounding those rallies, using isolated footage and even doctored images to manufacture a false sense that entire American cities had fallen to BLM and antifa.",
            "And the vilification worked. Everyday people really seemed to want to kill protesters: The Boston Globe analyzed 139 cases of vehicles ramming protesters in just 16 months following Floyd’s death, leading to more than 100 injuries and three deaths. The Cedar Rapids community remembers that era well, because their state was home to no fewer than four vehicular attacks against protesters in 2020 alone.",
            "Today, political violence is a regular feature at civic events, and not just at far-right and MAGA rallies. Gun violence is an ever-present threat across the country, and even on the rare day where a mass shooting doesn’t happen, droves of armed demonstrators and militia groups show up to political events to ensure that the specter remains. Meanwhile, far-right street gangs like the Proud Boys are now mobilizing to all manner of community gatherings in service to the right wing’s various grievances.",
            "When the GOP was up in arms about LGBTQ issues, armed Proud Boys rushed drag events, and their fascist cousins in a group called Patriot Front threatened community Pride celebrations. When the right-wing conspiracy theory of the day was that The Walt Disney Co. was grooming children, Proud Boys showed up to Disney events and threatened attendees, calling them “pedophiles.” And when Roe was overturned and liberal demonstrators filled the streets, the Proud Boys and heavily armed members of various militia groups showed up to intimidate the crowds. These incidents are accelerating as election season draws nearer.",
            "This appears to be the new normal in America. Politically charged violence, having gone unchecked for years, is no longer a fear but an expectation for many politically active Americans. For Cedar Rapids residents, it’s not a question of if, but when.",
            "“Obviously this is going to happen again,” said another woman struck by the truck, who asked not to be named. “I don’t know if it’ll be in Cedar Rapids, but it happens everywhere, all the time, so it will happen again, and the public response will be predictably terrible.”",
            "She paused, then continued: “Knowing that, what I’m trying to figure out now is, what do you do after this happens? What do you do?”",

            "ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — As missed warning signs pile up in investigations of mass killings, New York state is rolling out a novel strategy to screen applicants for gun permits. People seeking to carry concealed handguns will be required to hand over their social media accounts for a review of their “character and conduct.”",
            "It’s an approach applauded by many Democrats and national gun control advocacy groups, but some experts have raised questions about how the law will be enforced and address free speech concerns.",
            "Some of the local officials who will be tasked with reviewing the social media content also are asking whether they'll have the resources and, in some cases, whether the law is even constitutional.",
            "Sheriffs haven’t received additional money or staffing to handle a new application process, said Peter Kehoe, the executive director of the New York Sheriffs’ Association. The law, he asserted, infringes on Second Amendment rights, and while applicants must list their social media accounts, he doesn't think local officials will necessarily look at them.",
            "“I don’t think we would do that,” Kehoe said. “I think it would be a constitutional invasion of privacy.”",
            "The new requirement, which takes effect in September, was included in a law passed last week that sought to preserve some limits on firearms after the Supreme Court ruled that most people have a right to carry a handgun for personal protection. It was signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, who noted shooters sometimes telegraph their intent to hurt others.",
            "Increasingly, young men have gone online to drop hints of what’s to come before executing a mass killing, including the gunman who killed 19 children and two teachers at an Uvalde, Texas, elementary school.",
            "Under the law, applicants have to provide local officials with a list of current and former social media accounts from the previous three years. It will be up to local sheriff's staff, judges or country clerks to scroll through those profiles as they check whether applicants have made statements suggesting dangerous behavior.",
            "The law also will require applicants to undergo hours of safety training, prove they’re proficient at shooting, provide four character references and sit for in-person interviews.",
            "The law reflects how the Supreme Court ruling has shifted responsibility to states for vetting those who carry firearms in public, said Tanya Schardt, senior counsel and director of state and federal policy for gun control advocacy organization Brady.",
            "Her group said it was not aware of any other states requiring gun permit applicants to submit social media profiles.",
            "The new approach, however, comes amid growing debate over the policing of social media posts and a legacy of unwarranted surveillance of Black and brown communities.",
            "“The question should be: Can we do this in an anti-racist way that does not create another set of violence, which is the state violence that happens through surveillance?” said University of Pennsylvania social policy, communications and medicine professor Desmond Upton Patton, who also founded SAFElab, a research initiative studying violence involving youths of color.",
            "Meanwhile, gun rights advocates are blasting the law.",
            "“You’re also going to have to tell them your social media accounts because New York wants to thoroughly investigate you to figure out if you’re some of those dangerous law-abiding citizens who are taking the country by storm and causing crime to skyrocket,” Jared Yanis, host of the YouTube channel Guns & Gadgets, says in a widely viewed video on the new law. “What have we come to?”",
            "Hochul, who also has tasked state police with routing out extremism online, didn't immediately respond to a list of questions about the social media requirement, including how the state will address free speech and privacy concerns.",
            "“Often the sticking point is: How do we go about enforcing this?” Metro State University criminal justice professor James Densley, cofounder of research initiative The Violence Project, said. “I think it starts to open up a bit of a can of worms, because no one quite knows the best way to go about doing it.”",
            "It can be tricky, he said, to decode social media posts by younger people, who could simply be expressing themselves by posting a music video.",
            "“Where this will get tricky is to what extent this is expression and to what extent is this evidence of wrongdoing?” Densley said.",
            "Spokespeople for the social media platforms Facebook, Twitter, 4Chan and Parler didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.",
            "New York should instead consider giving the job to a trained group tasked with figuring out how to best reach out to people online who are showing signs of radicalization or trauma and may need help, Patton said.",
            "“There's a lot of nuance and contextual issues. We speak differently; how we communicate, that could be misunderstood,” Patton said. “I’m concerned we don’t have the right people or the right tools in place to do this in a way that’s useful in actually preventing violence.”",
            "Adam Scott Wandt, a public policy professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said that he supports gun control, but that he worries the New York law could set a precedent for mandatory disclosure of social media activity for people seeking other types of licenses from the state.",
            "New York's law is rushed and vague, said Wandt, who teaches law enforcement personnel how to conduct searches on people through social media.",
            "“I think that what we might have done as a state here in New York is, we may have confirmed their worst fears — that a slippery slope will be created that will slowly reduce their rights to carry guns and allow a bureaucracy to decide, based on unclear criteria, who can have a gun and who cannot,” Wandt said. “Which is exactly what the Supreme Court was trying to avoid.”",

            "The American Academy of Pediatrics recently updated its breastfeeding guidance for the first time in a decade — and one of the changes isn’t sitting well with some people.",
            "Many of the recommendations in the new policy statement released on June 27 are similar to the group’s previous guidance. For example, the AAP still recommends mothers breastfeed exclusively for the first six months of an infant’s life. At that point, solid foods can also be introduced in addition to breastmilk.",
            "One notable change is that the organization is now encouraging breastfeeding for two years or more, up from the previous recommendation of one year or more.",
            "“The AAP supports continued breastfeeding, along with appropriate complementary foods introduced at about 6 months, for as long as mutually desired by mother and child for 2 years or beyond,” the policy statement reads, noting that this recommendation aligns with the guidelines of the World Health Organization and other medical organizations.",
            "In the update, the group acknowledged that “significant societal changes are required” in order for parents to meet these goals. They called for pediatricians to support families who want to keep nursing and advocate for policy changes — such as universal paid family leave, workplace protections for pumping and insurance coverage for lactation supplies and support — that would make it more feasible in the U.S.",
            "The policy statement’s lead author, Dr. Joan Meek, told The New York Times that the update was based on research about the health benefits of longer-duration breastfeeding, especially for the mother. These include things like reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, breast cancer and ovarian cancer — though experts like health economist Emily Oster, author of “Cribsheet,” argue that these benefits may be overstated and are not well-supported by the data.",
            "With the update, the AAP also aims to normalize breastfeeding past the one-year mark for families who choose to do so — a decision mothers are sometimes ridiculed for, Meek told HuffPost.",
            "“Studies show us that some women are reluctant to share their continued breastfeeding with even their health care providers, because they have not felt supported in continuing to breastfeed beyond a year,” she wrote in an email.",
            "Reducing stigma around extended breastfeeding and calling for policy changes that make families’ nursing goals more realistic is, indeed, a good thing.",
            "As Karrie Locher — a registered nurse, certified lactation counselor and mother of four — told HuffPost: “Though we know that the benefits of breastmilk don’t just ‘shut off’ at one year, it has still unfortunately been a source of judgment when parents choose to breastfeed past 1... [The new guideline] also helps set a precedent that will hopefully trickle down into maternity leave laws, child care, insurance coverage for lactation support and pumping laws.”",
            "Some women are frustrated by the new guidelines.",
            "Despite the AAP’s good intentions, some have expressed concern that the new recommendation — and the timing of it — puts even more pressure on already overwhelmed moms. In this country there are already so many barriers to breastfeeding at all, let alone for two years.",
            "Then there’s the fact that this new guidance came in the midst of the ongoing formula shortage that’s been rife with shameful messaging about how women should “just breastfeed” because “breastfeeding is free” — as if those are viable solutions to the problem.",
            "“For women who are not able to breastfeed or pump breastmilk for myriad reasons, now being told that they should strive to breastfeed or pump for even longer is going to further the endless cycle of guilt that they may already feel for not being able to fulfill this element of being a mother,” organizational psychologist Allison S. Gabriel — a professor at the University of Arizona’s Eller College of Management who studies women in the workplace — told HuffPost.",
            "Adding insult to injury: the guidelines were released days after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, “when millions of American women are alarmed about restrictions on their reproductive and physical autonomy” — a move that “struck many as clueless and even callous,” opinion writer Jessica Grose wrote for The Times.",
            "The AAP does suggest pediatricians have “nonjudgmental conversations” with families about their breastfeeding goals, and recognizes that extended breastfeeding — or any breastfeeding, for that matter — is “not always possible, despite the best of intentions.” Locher said that while she appreciates this acknowledgement, the new recommendation could still make some parents, herself included, feel like they’re not doing enough.",
            "“Making it to the previously recommended one-year mark may have proven hard enough for some parents. Now, two years is suddenly recommended ― which may make parents feel like they’re always falling short if breastfeeding isn’t working for them, or if they previously weaned their child any earlier than two years,” Locher said. “There is already so much societal pressure to breastfeed ― yet the current support is lacking, which makes this new ‘goal’ or recommendation feel even more unattainable for some of us.”",
            "“It feels a bit defeating, as we already have so many expectations as parents, yet such little support in place,” she added. “There should also be more support and acknowledgement for the numerous parents who cannot or do not breastfeed.”",
            "In response to some of the pushback, Dr. Lori Feldman-Winter, chair of the AAP Section on Breastfeeding, told HuffPost: “We were careful to preface the recommendation by centering mothers and babies, that breastfeeding should last as long as mutually desired.” Meek also said that the guidelines “support making decisions about infant feeding in the manner that is best for [one’s] family” and that the AAP’s goal is to “support all moms and families.”",
            "Workplace support for lactating moms is lacking.",
            "For mothers who work outside of the home, the new recommendations may be particularly frustrating. As Grose pointed out in her piece for The Times, the PUMP Act — a bill designed to extend workplace breastfeeding protections to millions of women who aren’t covered by existing law — failed to pass the senate just before Roe was struck down.",
            "“There is zero federal response in the United States to support paid family leave and access to resources aimed at facilitating breastfeeding or pumping breastmilk,” Gabriel said. “The AAP themselves recognizes a litany of reasons why these recommendations that they themselves are making are not going to materialize.”",
            "Under federal law, hourly workers are entitled to breaks so they can pump during the workday. But the breaks do not have to be paid, meaning these parents are “literally having to make trade-offs between paying their bills and feeding their child,” Gabriel said.",
            "“These types of recommendations do not exist in a vacuum,” she added. “With recommendations to breastfeed for two years means there must be policy to actually support women and their babies in this endeavor.”",
            "Moms’ mental health needs to be taken into account, too.",
            "People have also pointed out that the updated guidelines show a lack of regard for mothers’ mental health. Many women who struggle with breastfeeding say that it had a negative impact on their mental and emotional state. Researchers have found a link between negative early breastfeeding experiences and postpartum depression, though the association between the two isn’t well-understood.",
            "“There is zero mention of maternal mental health, anxiety, and depression, all of which can become exacerbated from the demands of trying to balance motherhood, breastfeeding and other role domains — e.g., worker, spouse or partner or friend,” Gabriel said. “To make these recommendations and not acknowledge that mothers are struggling to stay afloat completely misses the moment of where many mothers are — myself included.”",
            "At the end of the day, women should be empowered to make the choices that best serve their personal motherhood journey, Gabriel said — whatever those may be.",
            "“At the core, I believe the AAP is recognizing that in part by saying they want to remove the judgement and add support,” she said. “It just has to be to remove the judgment and add support for any decision women decide to make.”",
            "For any parent who felt less-than after reading about the new guidelines, Locher offered some comforting words.",
            "“What you’re doing is enough. What you’re doing is the right choice for your baby. The updated guidelines are in place to hopefully initiate change in policies to support breastfeeding parents, but they do not define your parenthood journey or your goals.”"

            "A panic attack is a physiological reaction in which the body’s fight-or-flight response is activated to help a person prepare for something dangerous. People often say a panic attack feels like they’re having a heart attack or dying — it can trigger intense anxiety along with a mix of physical symptoms, including a fast heartbeat, sweating, trembling and shortness of breath.",
            "Anxiety attacks, on the other hand, typically occur when people no longer feel in control of their anxiety. “The anxiety sort of crosses a threshold where it’s no longer comfortable or manageable for someone,” said David Klemanski, a Yale Medicine psychologist and assistant professor of psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine.",
            "During both types of attacks, adrenaline pumps throughout the body. When you come down from that surge in adrenaline, you may feel zapped because you just went through an intense emotional experience and, in certain cases, a taxing physical reaction as well.",
            "“When you come down from that, there’s going to be a lot of consequences. Your body is actually going to feel physically fatigued because you went through a pretty big event,” Klemanski said.",
            "After an attack, people often feel out of it and exhausted. And if you hyperventilated, you may even feel sore — particularly within the chest muscles. Some may experience nausea, gastrointestinal issues, headaches and migraines along with flare-ups of symptoms associated with chronic conditions they have, according to Stern.",
            "Klemanski said the aftereffects that come with a panic attack are likely to be more intense than those that follow an anxiety attack. And, depending on the person, the aftereffects can last for a couple of hours, or a full day or two.",
            "How to cope with an anxiety or panic attack ‘hangover’",
            "If you regularly experience anxiety attacks or panic attacks, Stern recommended learning about what you need during and after the attack, so you can have a plan in place. Klemanski said treatment methods like cognitive behavioral theory can help you learn how to manage the anxiety and panic when it sets in, so you won’t have to deal with such severe “hangover” symptoms afterward.",
            "But if the attack already came and went, and you’re feeling pretty out of it, there are a few ways to mitigate the symptoms.",
            "The first step is to pause and take a breather to slow down your system. “Make your environment, if you can, feel comfortable around you,” Stern said. Turn the lights off, put some calming music on — do what you need to calm down and feel grounded.",
            "Klemanski recommended practicing mindfulness. Bring yourself to the present moment and acknowledge whatever it is that you’re feeling physically and emotionally. Engaging in some deep breathing techniques — like diaphragmatic breathing, box breathing or rhythmic breathing — to regulate your body can also help with this.",
            "Practice all the traditionally healthy behaviors — like making sure you’re getting enough sleep and proper nutrition — and find someone to process your emotions with, whether it be a close friend or mental health professional. Stern said it’s crucial to reach out to someone who will be grounding and calming, not someone who will rev you up even more. Stern also suggested finding a way to move when you can — whether that means going for a walk or doing some gentle stretches.",
            "Be patient with yourself. It will take some time for the aftereffects to subside. “Realize that, hey, the worst of it’s over and as long as I try my best and am compassionate with myself, I can get through this with time,” Klemanski said."

            "It’s official: A drink named for a movie star is what everyone’s quaffing this summer. The Dirty Shirley is growing in popularity as temperatures rise, with the hashtag #dirtyshirley trending at more than 10 million on TikTok.",
            "If you’re looking for a little backstory, here you go: Ninety years ago, Shirley Temple was a box office dynamo, reigning supreme in a stream of movies in which she pouted pertly, tap danced prettily and tossed about her famous ringlet curls to the envy of little girls everywhere.",
            "Her childhood fame was so enormous that it led to the creation of the OG mocktail, the Shirley Temple, which traditionally is made with lemon-lime soda or ginger ale, a dash of grenadine and a maraschino cherry. The movie star eventually grew up, changed her name to Shirley Temple Black when she married, and went on to do great things, including serving as United States ambassador to Ghana and what was then Czechoslovakia.",
            "As with most things that are adorably nostalgic and retro, enterprising souls have found a way to make it a lot more fun with a newly-naughty version. The eponymous cocktail has now grown up and changed its name too, thanks to the addition of a shot of vodka.",
            "Jim Wrigley, beverage manager at Cayman Islands’ Kimpton Seafire Resort & Spa’s Coccoloba restaurant, explained: “The term ‘sucio,’ which means ‘dirty’ in Spanish, is used ubiquitously to mean adding a shot of booze to anything non-alcoholic.” (Want to honor the grownup instead of the kid? Subbing in dark rum creates a Shirley Temple Black, naturally.)",
            "Simple And Trending: Here’s The Recipe",
            "“A Dirty Shirley is the cocktail version of comfort food — with a cherry on top,” said Emily Darchuk, founder and CEO of Wheyward Spirit, a woman-owned and operated sustainable distilled spirit company. “It’s the quintessential mocktail with an adult twist, and it’s a refreshing upgrade from a typical soda mixer. Plus, there’s that added nostalgia and the beautiful ‘look at me’ pink color to enjoy on equally vibrant summer days.”",
            "Mixologist Lauren Pellecchia agreed: “It’s a big seller with the 25-to-35 age demographic, I think because it’s nostalgic, fun and just flat-out tastes really good. It’s not a serious drink, and after the last few very serious years we all deserve some lightheartedness. A Dirty Shirley is something that anyone can make at home and confidently order out at the bar — which is not always the case for other drinks that have been popular over the past few years.”",
            "There are tons of variations (which we’ll get to in a minute), but the basic recipe is simple: Over an ice-filled Collins glass, add 2 ounces vodka, 1 ounce grenadine and 8 ounces lemon-lime soda or ginger ale. Add a maraschino cherry. Drink up, and feel yourself starting to drift away on the Good Ship Lollipop.",
            "Your soda preferences might depend on where you grew up. “I’ve learned there’s a regional divide,” Pellecchia said. “I grew up in Ohio, with a Sprite or 7-Up base, but in other parts of the country, ginger ale was the norm. I now love the hint of ginger that a splash of ginger ale gives to the drink.”",
            "And, she noted, pay attention to the type of vodka you use: “You need a good vodka, for sure. I’m really liking Broken Shed right now.”",
            "How To Tone Down The Sweetness",
            "In the same way that a grown-ass adult can only listen to so many renditions of a Shirley Temple song, you might reach your sugar intake limit after just one of these glow-in-the-dark cocktails. No worries — mixologists have responded.",
            "“Both Shirley Temples and Dirty Shirleys are classic drinks that will never go out of style,” said Carlos Kronen, executive director of The Bartender Company. “That being said, in the San Francisco area, where I live, we’ve noticed a shift toward beverages with lower sugar content.”",
            "“One modification we’ve made to meet the shifting demand is to swap club soda in for Sprite, which significantly lowers the amount of sugar in the drink,” Kronen continued.",
            "Still crave a bit of sweetness? Kronen suggested this: “Consider using Mexican Sprite, which uses real sugar cane instead of high-fructose corn syrup. The quality is higher, the flavor is brighter and it’s less processed.”",
            "Brandon Julien, head bartender at ANA Bar & Eatery at New York’s Hudson Yards, is all about the balance: “The last thing you want is a drink that tastes too sweet like cough syrup, or too sour to the point you pucker up. I’ve found that Black Infusions dark cherry vodka elevates the cocktail with a natural sweetness that isn’t overpowering, so I make my Dirty Shirley with 2 ounces Black Infusions dark cherry, 2 ounces ginger ale and 1/4 ounce fresh lime juice.”",
            "Julien also noted that there’s an option for on-the-go: “Black Infusions recently came out with a canned Dirty Shirley, so they’ve done all of the work for you.”",
            "Tips For Making Dirty Shirleys At Home",
            "If you’re making Dirty Shirleys at home, you can add all sorts of upscale twists, but the key, as in cooking, is to taste as you go. “Less is more when it comes to the grenadine and soda,” said Joseph Neis, senior food and beverage manager at Conrad New York Downtown. “Before following a recipe, add a little bit of each of those ingredients, taste the drink and see if you like it. You can always add more, but once it’s in the cocktail, you can never take it away.”",
            "Pellecchia suggested using Luxardo cherries and juice as a special touch. “I also enjoy adding a dash or two of bitters,” she said. “You can never go wrong with Angostura, but I’ve really liked adding Tao Bitters Sweet Ginger. It has a ginger base with coriander and pepper notes with a hint of mint, all of which complement the flavors of the cocktail.”",
            "Some mixologists insist on using homemade grenadine. If the idea of making homemade ingredients is daunting, never fear. Darchuk shared her own “secret ingredient” recipe and the reasoning behind it: “Making your own grenadine syrup at home from pomegranate juice will give the cocktail a deeper — and more natural — flavor, but the color will be less cherry-red than the artificially colored store-bought syrups. To brighten the red color, I add hibiscus leaves for color and to infuse a nice tartness.”",
            "“Secret Ingredient” Homemade Grenadine From Wheyward Spirit’s Emily Darchuk",
            "2 cups pomegranate juice2 cups sugar1 teaspoon orange extract5 to 6 dried hibiscus flowers",
            "Heat and stir sugar and juice on the stove until boiling, then remove from heat. Add leaves and allow the mixture to steep while cooling. Remove leaves and store syrup in the refrigerator, adding a splash of alcohol to the syrup to increase its shelf life.",
            "Now that you’ve gotten into the DIY spirit, consider upping your vodka game, as well. From cookbook author and food photographer Jackie Alpers comes this suggestion to add flavor to the base alcohol: “Make your own infused cherry vodka by smashing and soaking cherries in the alcohol. Be sure to use good vodka, like Tito’s Handmade Vodka.” Other elements in her cocktail: “Sparkling lemon-lime flavored mineral water instead of soda and a splash of Rose’s lime juice for a little extra sweetness.”",
            "A Lower ABV Recipe",
            "“I’m a real sommelier but a lazy at-home mixologist, and I like to have a summer cocktail without getting drunk,” said Cara Patricia, CEO and co-founder of DECANTsf, a woman-, queer- and BIPOC-owned bottle shop and bar in San Francisco.",
            "Her version provides a more session-able cocktail. “For a low ABV Dirty Shirley, I mix 1.5 ounces Manzanilla or Fino sherry and 1.5 ounces Istine Rosé Vermouth di Radda in a highball glass with ice, add half a can of Spindrift Lemon Seltzer, a squeeze of lemon and a fresh summer cherry to garnish.”",
            "Serving Suggestions",
            "Before you get started, remember this advice from Wrigley: “Chill everything! This drink is boozy and sweet, and the colder it is, the less those two characteristics take over. Keep glasses in the freezer, use loads of ice and keep the booze and lengthener (lemon lime soda or ginger ale) in the fridge.”",
            "“This drink should be built in the glass, so no shaker is needed,” Pellecchia said. “Just stir it gently with a spoon or straw to combine. I do like to use a Collins ice cube, which is a long, rectangular cube, because it slows dilution.”",
            "Darchuk agreed but prefers a different type of ice: “The rate of dilution is important, so serve it in a right-sized Collins glass and on crushed or pebble ice along with a straw or swizzle to allow mixing while sipping.”",
            "Of course, there’s always the opportunity to embrace your inner child when you’re making this particular cocktail. “When I was a kid, the Shirley Temples I got were never big enough,” Alpers said. “If you’re the same way, serve yours in a really big glass, like a pilsner, and add extra cherries — lots of them.”"

            "A tornado in southwestern Ohio arrived Wednesday with little warning, displacing hundreds of families and leaving thousands without power.",
            "The tornado tore through downtown Goshen Township at 2:30 p.m., according to CNN. Local police and fire departments, as well as schools and homes, were left heavily damaged. Residents of the suburb, which lies 30 miles from Cincinnati, had mere seconds to prepare.",
            "“Our phones alerted, and the storm hit us about 90 seconds later,” said Steve Pegram, the township administrator.",
            "Mike Boehmer, a spokesman for the emergency management office, said two elementary schools, one middle school and a high school were also damaged. He noted they were dangerously close to the tornado’s path, and that the time of its arrival likely saved untold lives.",
            "“They are all in close proximity to the fire department and the police department,” said Boehmer. “We are lucky that it happened in the middle of the day. Most people were still at work when it happened and not in those homes.”",
            "Based on the damage, the National Weather Service stated the tornado reached an EF2 rating on the Enhanced Fujita scale, according to AccuWeather. Winds of that nature can reach devastating speeds between 111 and 135 mph.",
            "The tornado arrived during a barrage of storms from the Midwest and left nearly 100,000 residents in the Cincinnati area without power. Officials declared a state of emergency after several people were injured and countless buildings were left missing their roofs.",
            "Goshen officials said Wednesday evening that one resident was struck by debris and that a firefighter injured his hand while operating a chainsaw.",
            "According to WLWT5, first responders in Miami Township, a Montgomery County suburb, reported a third injury from flying debris later that night.",
            "“Numerous residences were impacted, and we believe that several hundred people have been displaced from their homes,” said Pam Haverkos, the Clermont County emergency management director.",
            "Many Miami Township residents were left scrambling for safety after the local tornado shelter was damaged. Images on social media depicted grocery stores, driving schools and an Allstate insurance building in shambles. Drivers on Highway 28 remained in their cars, waiting for first responders.",
            "Pegram said up to 200 homes were damaged, which resulted in numerous gas leak reports across counties. More than 15,000 residents of Clermont County alone are still without power as of noon Thursday, according to Power Outage.",
            "“Probably the biggest message to residents and people in our area right now... Stay away,” Pegram told Local 12. “We don’t need a lot of cars, we don’t need a lot of people and we don’t need help, we have plenty of resources on scene handling all of our fire and EMS needs, handling our search and rescue needs.”"

            "Famed actor James Caan has died at the age of 82, his family announced Thursday. No cause of death was immediately reported.",
            "Caan, known for his performances in films such as “Brian’s Song,” “Misery” and “Elf,” was nominated for an Academy Award for his role as Sonny Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola’s 1972 classic “The Godfather,” widely regarded as one of the best films ever made.",
            "Caan died on Wednesday, July 6, his family said via the actor’s Twitter account. Caan himself was active on Twitter in his later years, always ending his missives with “End of tweet,” which his family nodded to in their announcement.",
            "Born in the Bronx in 1940, Caan was raised in Sunnyside, Queens. After studying at New York’s Neighborhood Playhouse, a famed conservatory, he began working as an actor both onstage and in television roles in the early 1960s. He eventually transitioned to film, starring in Howard Hawks’ 1965 racing movie “Red Line 7000” and Coppola’s 1969 drama “The Rain People.”",
            "Caan’s breakthrough moment came in 1971 when he played terminally ill football player Brian Piccolo in the made-for-television film “Brian’s Song.” Both the film and Caan’s performance were critically acclaimed.",
            "The following year, Coppola cast Caan in “The Godfather,” placing him in what would become his signature role as Sonny Corleone. His turn as the hot-headed eldest brother who comes to a violent, untimely end earned him many accolades, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Caan briefly reprised the role in a flashback scene in the 1974 sequel, “The Godfather Part II.”",
            "Caan’s career continued for decades. Among his most memorable appearances was his performance in the 1990 film adaptation of Stephen King’s “Misery,” in which Caan played a famous author who is held captive by an obsessed fan. Caan also played Will Ferrell’s workaholic biological father in 2003’s beloved Christmas movie “Elf.”",
            "Prior to his death, Caan was slated to star in Coppola’s next film, “Megalopolis.”"

            "Many of us grew up with these words echoing in our ears at every pool party or beach blowout, but were our parents right to set a strict 30-minute buffer zone between lunchtime and swim time?",
            "To get to the bottom of this very popular safety theory, we asked for input from people who would have the answers: emergency room physician Dr. Jim Keany of Providence Mission Hospital in Mission Viejo, California, and registered nurse and triathlon coach John Rhodes of Axes Performance Coaching.",
            "The idea that you need to wait to swim after you eat is a myth based on a false understanding of bodily functions",
            "We’ll start off by answering the big question regarding this topic: “There is no medical evidence that supports waiting at least 30 minutes after eating before swimming. There have been no cases or evidence suggesting that eating just before swimming led to someone drowning,” Keany said.",
            "Keany explained that this myth first gained popularity due to a simple misconception of medical science. In the past, “it was assumed that because more blood was flowing to the stomach for digestion, less oxygen would flow to the arms and legs, which could lead to someone drowning.” However, Keany assures us that “your body supplies more than enough oxygen to your stomach, arms and legs when you are swimming.”",
            "Eating before swimming could be a hazard if you’re planning to engage in heavy swim exercise",
            "If you’re planning some light recreational swimming with friends after enjoying backyard barbecue fare, you’re not at major risk for heavy cramping. But if you’re a competitive swimmer in training or otherwise feel the urge to strenuously swim laps, Rhodes warns against starting right after you eat.",
            "“Eating a big meal, then going for a hard swim workout, may lead to GI distress, like nausea or vomiting,” Rhodes said. Instead, save the Olympic-level swim training for another (less food-focused) occasion.",
            "The same eating habits that might cause stomach discomfort on dry land can also lead to cramping in the water",
            "When we asked Keany whether certain types of food are more likely to cause cramps than others, he told us that “studies consistently show that this isn’t the case. And, according to the American Red Cross, you don’t have to restrict certain foods before swimming.”",
            "However, Keany does say that “any dietary indiscretions that might cause stomach upset without swimming could lead to the same issues that would cause cramping while swimming. Overeating [and consuming] excessively spicy or acidic foods can also cause stomach cramps even under normal circumstances, so it is wise to use your own judgment” when swimming after eating these foods.",
            "Alcohol, on the other hand, can prove very dangerous (and even fatal) when combined with swimming",
            "For adult guests at a weekend barbecue, crisp beers and frozen margs often make welcome pairings for beloved cookout dishes. Keany insists in no uncertain terms that alcohol and swimming do not go well together.",
            "“Alcohol does play a significant role in swim safety,” he said. “In fact, drinking alcohol significantly increases the potential for drowning. This is because it impairs coordination, judgment, balance, response to cold and the ability to safely swim.”",
            "Keany’s facts grow even darker when the topic of mortality rates comes up: “According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, up to 70% of deaths associated with water recreation among adolescents and adults occurred when alcohol was involved. An adult can drown in only a minute, so being aware of the level of danger surrounding water and alcohol could save their life.”",
            "There are several key signs that indicate when someone is too inebriated to safely swim. “[Look for] a loss of good decision-making and an increase in risk-taking, slurred speech or stumbling, and an increased body temperature (drinking causes your body to overheat, which can affect your ability to swim safely),” he said.",
            "For the safest results, avoid swimming if you’ve consumed any alcohol. But if you or a friend are determined to get in the pool post-cocktail, be sure to have a sober buddy nearby. “Thirty-two percent of drowning deaths happen when someone is swimming alone, which is why it is important to swim with a friend,” he said. “If your friend or family member is determined to swim, do not leave them alone. If you think they might endanger their body or health, send someone to get help.”",
            "More ways to keep your pool party as safe as possible",
            "Avoid any and all glass servingware",
            "People who attend pool parties often walk around with bare feet (or feet covered by flimsy flip-flops). For the safety of your guests’ toes and soles (and for the safety of your fancy glassware), “make sure to serve food on plastic plates and platters and provide guests with plastic [or paper] plates, plastic utensils and plastic cups to help people avoid stepping on broken glass,” Keany said. Shop some of our favorite shatterproof glassware here.",
            "Keep a first-aid kit and a CPR-knowledgable adult near the pool",
            "No one likes to consider the idea of a guest being injured at their pool party, but smart hosts are prepared for any possibility. “Keep a first-aid kit near the pool. Double check that you have plenty of bandages and disinfecting solution,” Keany said, adding, “Make sure that you or several guests at the party know CPR — it can save someone’s life!” Check out our top picks for first-aid kits here."

            "PAMPLONA, Spain (AP) — The first bull run in three years took place Thursday at the San Fermín festival in the Spanish city of Pamplona. No one was gored, but several runners took knocks and hard falls as tens of thousands people reveled in the return of one of Europe’s most famous traditional events.",
            "Six bulls guided by six tame oxen charged through Pamplona’s streets for around two minutes and 35 seconds without provoking too much carnage among the thousands of observers and participants cramming the course.",
            "Several runners were stomped, trampled or shoved to the cobblestone pavement. A animal’s horn smacked at least two men in the head, but neither suffered a skewering.",
            "The Pamplona hospital said six people were brought in for treatment. They included a 30-year-old American man who fractured his left arm and a 16-year-old Spanish girl who lost part of a finger in the bullring, where a pile-up of runners occurred at the entrance. Four Spanish men between the ages of 19 and 45 also were injured.",
            "Ryan Ward, an American tourist from San Diego, California, said the risk of running with the bulls was well worth the rush.",
            "“I feel like I need to cry. It’s just so many emotions built up in me, running with ‘mis amigos’ (my friends). I don’t know where they are, I lost everyone,” he said after finishing the bull run unscathed.",
            "“It felt like two seconds, it was probably like a minute when I actually had the bulls running by me, but it felt so quick, like a blink and it was gone,” Ward continued. “It’s amazing, incredible, one of the best experiences I’ve ever had.”",
            "Thursday’s early morning bull run was the first of eight scheduled. The rest of day usually includes massive drinking, eating and attending cultural events.",
            "Eight people were gored during the 2019 festival, the last held before the coronavirus pandemic. Sixteen people have died in bull runs since 1910, most recently in 2009.",
            "The bulls that run each morning are killed in the afternoon by professional bullfighters. Animal rights activists have campaigned against the slaughter of the animals, but bullfights are still popular among segments of Spanish society and an integral part of the San Fermín festival.",
            "The incredibly popular Pamplona festivities were canceled in 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic.",
            "Spain’s strong vaccination program has allowed life to return to more or less normal, but a recent uptick in cases led Pamplona authorities to recommend using face masks when necessary. That said, masks were a very rare sight among the throngs of people packing the city’s square for the official kickoff of the party on Wednesday or during the first bull run.",
            "Thousands of men, and some women, participate in the “encierros,” or bull runs, trying to avoid the massive bulls and oxen that thunder along the narrow, twisting cobblestone streets of Pamplona’s old quarter.",
            "The course of 875 meters (956 yards) is sprayed with a substance to help prevent the bulls from slipping on the tight corners. The run usually is over within three heart-stopping minutes.",
            "Expert bull runners, mostly locals, try to sprint at full steam just in the front of the bull horns before peeling off at the last second. The inexperienced, a group that includes most foreigners, do well enough to scramble out of the way, often ending up in piles of fellow runners.",
            "Almost everyone in Pamplona this week wears the traditional white shirt and pants with red sash and neckerchief for the festival.",

            "The singer posted three videos on Tuesday that chronicled her well-deserved getaway with husband Sam Asghari. While their location remains a secret, the happy couple is clearly enjoying their marriage.",
            "The first clip shows Asghari aboard their private jet carrying the couple’s dog to his seat. The second, scored to a Timmy Trumpet cover of “Mad World” by Gary Jules, showed the newlyweds kissing on a boat while basking in the sun.",
            "“Playing the role of How To Lose A Guy in 10 days,” Spears captioned the clip. “Am I obnoxious enough ??? Do you guys think its real ????”",
            "The third and most-liked clip showed Spears luxuriating in picturesque waters, posing in her bikini, and strutting towards the camera topless on a beach — while covering her breasts with her hands.",
            "“Part 2 of the Honeymoon here in this unbelievable tropical piece of paradise,” she wrote. “No this is not a girls gone wild campaign … It’s simply me living my life!!! This is what happens when you do a two week yacht island vacation … jumping from island to island is literally insane!!!”",
            "These videos come one month after Spears married Asghari at her property in Thousand Oaks, California, on June 9.",
            "While private, the star-studded ceremony doubled as a convention for A-listers and industry colleagues, alike. It wasn’t without surprises and mishaps, however. Spears and Madonna recreated their iconic kiss from the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards for attendees, but only after an uninvited guest was arrested for trespassing.",
            "Spears’ first husband, childhood friend Jason Alexander, showed up before the ceremony and livestreamed the act on Instagram. Rather than forever hold his peace, he asked for Spears’ whereabouts. He was heard saying he was there to “crash the wedding,” which he called a “bullshit wedding.”",
            "When the Ventura County Sheriff’s Department responded to the trespassing report, they noted Alexander had an outstanding felony warrant from 2016. He was promptly arrested as a result, according to NBC News.",
            "Spears’ marriage to Asghari marked the third time she tied the knot. She was only married to Alexander for 55 hours before they got an annulment in 2004 and married dancer Kevin Federline later that year. They divorced in 2007 after welcoming two sons.",
            "Spears was placed under a strict conservatorship the following year that allowed her little control over her life, finances and relationships. She and Asghari were engaged shortly after her father filed papers to end the conservatorship in 2021.",
            "As for Asghari, he posted a few updates to his Instagram Stories himself, where he was seen kayaking, working out and smoking a cigar aboard a boat.",

            "And that, my friends, is what “jello skin” is all about.",
            "What is jello skin?",
            "″[Jello skin] does not only have a healthy appearance but in fact will contain a healthy amount of collagen, as well as other elastin and subcutaneous fat, on the inside that gives it those amazing qualities,“ said Dr. Jaimie DeRosa, a double-board certified facial plastic surgeon and founder of DeRosa Center Plastic Surgery & Med Spa in Boston and Palm Beach.",
            "Unlike some skin care trends, achieving jello skin is not as simple as applying certain skin care products. Lee ― who, it’s important to note, is not a skin care professional ― explained in a YouTube video that each letter in “jello” stands for a step in the process:",
            "Journey. Achieving jello skin is “not an overnight change,” Lee said, and you’ll need to put in the work because “consistency is key” for obtaining radiant skin.",
            "Eat balanced meals. Lee recommends eating foods that are good for your gut and trying to keep things about 80% healthy. (Again, remember that Lee is not a professional!)",
            "Lifestyle. This step goes hand in hand with “journey.” Find workouts you enjoy, discover what diet works best for you and see which skin care routine is best for your skin.",
            "Laugh. Blood circulation and lymphatic drainage is important for clear skin. Both can be achieved by using your facial muscles by smiling and laughing.",
            "Old is not bad. With age comes experience and confidence — plus, you’ll know what works for you. Embrace your skin and take care of it no matter your age.",
            "While this is just the advice of an influencer, experts are on board with the steps of this jello journey.",
            "“Women and men in their 20s and early 30s who have great healthy eating habits, avoid nicotine and alcohol and use sun protection will have more collagen than those who don’t,” said Dr. Lori Ann Musto, a doctor of osteopathic medicine and owner of Musto Medical Centers in California. Collagen is important because it gives our skin elasticity ― aka that bouncy, jello effect.",
            "“Unfortunately, as we age, the amount of collagen decreases, elasticity decreases, and skin begins to sag, losing its bounce,” Musto added.",
            "So how can you get plump, bouncy Jello skin of your own?",
            "Because of our individual skin issues, everyone’s path to jello skin won’t be the same, but here are some steps you can try.",

            "Eat the rainbow",
            "“Our nutrition status is reflected through our skin, especially as we lose collagen and elasticity starting at the age of 25,” explained Dr. Azza Halim, a board-certified doctor specializing in aesthetic medicine with practices in Chicago; Newport Beach, California; and Boca Raton, Florida. “When we have a diet that is plentiful in antioxidants and amino acids, we can help prevent free radical damage to our skin.”",
            "This means adding whole foods like fish, nuts, vegetables and fruits into your diet, which can provide beneficial nutrients like amino acids and omega-3s.",
            "Consider cosmetic treatments",
            "If you’ve tried the products and aren’t quite happy with your bounce, there are cosmetics procedures you can receive at your local med spa.",
            "“Luckily, there are a variety of treatments that can stimulate the production of collagen and elastin,” Motykie said. “I usually recommend Morpheus8, a micro-needling treatment that uses gold-plated needles to transmit high radio frequency, stimulating and remodeling collagen production to firm and tighten the skin. If the patient isn’t ready for Morpheus8, they can opt for traditional micro-needling or LED lights.”",

            "On April 4, a police officer shot Patrick Lyoya at point-blank range in the back of the head during a traffic stop in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Two months later, Kent County Prosecutor Chris Becker announced he was charging the officer, Christopher Schurr, with second-degree murder — making Schurr the first officer from the Grand Rapids Police Department to be charged with felony murder in the shooting of a civilian.",
            "The shooting, filmed by a witness, ignited outrage on social media. Lyoya’s death didn’t spark the same nationwide outrage as the killings of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, but it raised tensions in Grand Rapids and underlined the often-dangerous role police can play in minor traffic stops.",
            "Schurr said he pulled over Lyoya, a 26-year-old Black man, because his license plates were expired. Lyoya attempted to get away, and after a brief struggle, Schurr pulled out his gun and shot Lyoya in the back of the head while kneeling on top of him.",
            "Jack Glaser, a professor focusing on racial bias and law enforcement at the University of California, Berkeley, said body camera footage of the traffic stop shows Schurr approaching Lyoya aggressively.",
            "“You can go back and say the stop itself started on a bad note and was probably unnecessary,” Glaser told HuffPost. “The officer is very aggressive and moved in quickly and really contributes to a fraught situation where he is trying to get compliance and Mr. Lyoya is confused.”",
            "Minor Infractions, Major Consequences",
            "In the wake of recent police killings and shootings of people of color, the Police Reform Commission in Washington, D.C., proposed to the city council last year that police should no longer be responsible for addressing traffic violations. The commission suggested the Department of Transportation should handle them instead.",
            "In March, Los Angeles police approved new limitations on pretextual stops, or traffic stops in which officers pull someone over because they suspect they’ve committed another crime. If officers do make the stop, they will have to record it with a body-worn camera and state why they think a more serious crime occurred.",
            "In December, Pittsburgh banned traffic stops for minor violations — like broken taillights or headlights or improperly placed license plates — after the city council approved legislation it said should reduce traffic stops of people of color.",
            "Police have killed more than 400 motorists in the last five years who did not have a gun or knife and were not pursued for a violent crime, according to a 2021 New York Times investigation. More than three-quarters of the victims, like Lyoya, were trying to flee the stop.",
            "“We see this again and again, and there is not a good reason why armed police officers should be responding to enforcement,” Samuel Sinyangwe, a policing analyst who founded the police scorecard and maps police violence, told HuffPost.",
            "Many other policing experts agree. David Gans, director of the Human Rights, Civil Rights, & Citizenship program at the Constitutional Accountability Center, told HuffPost that police involvement in traffic stops is leading to “horrific” outcomes.",
            "Gans drew comparisons between Lyoya’s case and the killing of Philando Castile, a Black man who was killed in front of his child after he was stopped for a minor traffic violation in a suburb of Saint Paul, Minnesota, in 2016.",
            "“In the last number of years, we have seen time and time again how traffic stops end up with police killing unarmed Black men and women,” Gans said. “Jurisdictions are recognizing that.”",
            "Lansing is the only police department in Michigan to rethink how it allows officers to handle minor traffic violations. Cle Jackson, the president of the Grand Rapids NAACP, said his city should follow suit in the wake of Lyoya’s death.",
            "“For minor traffic infractions, I don’t think officers should be making stops related to that nature,” Jackson told HuffPost. “At the end of the day, no one should lose their life. It should not escalate to that level.”",
            "Seeking Policy Changes",
            "After the footage of Lyoya’s killing was released, some lawmakers demanded more accountability for state and local law enforcement, and his family members are planning to file a civil lawsuit after they receive details from a Freedom of Information Act request.",
            "Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.) introduced the OATH Act, which would set up a pilot program that increases funding for police body camera training. For reasons that remain unclear, Schurr’s camera turned off shortly before he killed Lyoya. Police officials have theorized that the camera was knocked off while Schurr pinned Lyoya down.",
            "“While body-worn cameras are intended to be a tool for accountability, there have been too many instances where BWCs have been mishandled. And oftentimes, footage that is captured is reviewed only after an incident occurs,” Lawrence said in a press release after introducing the legislation in April.",
            "Michigan also announced it would restart its pattern and practice investigation into the Grand Rapids City police department — which would address the tactical approach officers take in policing the community. The investigation will examine whether officers are purposely and disproportionately over-policing Black residents and other residents of color.",
            "Meanwhile, all eyes will be on Schurr’s trial.",
            "Schurr has been fired from the Grand Rapids Police Department. He’s the first officer from the department to be criminally indicted on a murder charge, according to the Kent County Prosecutor’s office. If convicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole.",
            "For police accountability advocates, the decision to charge Schurr came as a surprise, especially since the department initially refused to release his name after the shooting.",
            "Miriam Aukerman, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, said withholding Schurr’s name was “damaging to the integrity” of the investigation. Police Chief Eric Winstrom decided to release his name more than two weeks after the shooting because it was already publicly circulating.",
            "The NAACP’s Jackson hopes to see accountability for Lyoya’s death, but struggles with the 26-year-old being another person killed by police.",
            "“Now Patrick is a part of that class of alumni who have been slaughtered in the streets by an officer who was trigger-happy and could have totally defused the situation,” Jackson said."

Wade days earlier and ruled that states can ban abortion, the clinic was forced to suspend the procedures because of an 1800s-era state law banning them. The ACLU of West Virginia filed a lawsuit on behalf of the clinic, asking that the law be declared unenforceable so staff can immediately resume abortions. Other states are in various stages of legal limbo.",
            "Nationwide, workers at clinics that shuttered abortion services are feeling fear and stress as they try to pick up the pieces and chart a path forward. At the West Virginia center, the days following the historic court ruling brought on a different kind of grief for staff as their new reality set in, one Maness said will linger long after the initial trauma of the decision.",
            "The conversations with frantic patients that first day play on an inescapable loop in her head.",
            "“I don’t think any of us can block it out,” she said. “It’s constantly on our minds.”",
            "Like many clinics that perform abortions, the facility did not offer the procedure daily. Several days of the week are dedicated to routine gynecological care — cervical exams, cancer screenings — mostly for low-income patients on Medicaid with nowhere else to go. The resolve to continue that work has buoyed employees.",
            "Immediately after the decision’s release, Maness was one of a few staff members tasked with calling patients to cancel abortion appointments. On the other end of the line, she’d never before heard people speak with such fear.",
            "The entire staff found themselves in crisis mode for days, though they and others across the country expected the ruling for months. “You think you think you’re prepared for the moment, but you’re never really prepared until it’s a reality,” executive director Katie Quiñonez said.",
            "She watched her staff break down and sob. Some called patients or answered phones. Workers who had the day off showed up, some still in pajamas, to relieve colleagues and offer support. Quiñonez encouraged all to take breaks, often managing the phones herself.",
            "She’ll forever remember that Friday as one of the worst days of her life. Over the weekend, she shut off her phone, lay under a weighted blanket on her couch, ate junk food and watched television. It was the only way she could escape and cope.",
            "When she and her staff returned to work, she held off on filling the vacant slots from canceled abortion appointments. Some patients still needed other services, but she wanted to let workers catch their breath. She told them to come in late if needed. Clinic rooms remained largely empty, dark and quiet.",
            "But still, the phones rang.",
            "Beth Fiddler sat at her desk behind the clinic’s glass reception window in the waiting room. She had no patients to check in, no Medicaid data to scan into charts, no informative packets to hand out.",
            "Instead, she found herself answering the same questions again and again, referring callers to a hotline or website to help them find the nearest out-of-state abortion provider.",
            "“You guys are going to close up soon, right?” No, the clinic will be open to provide other services.",
            "“Can I get Plan B - the ‘morning after’ pill? What about an IUD, or other birth control?” I’ll help you make an appointment.",
            "“You’re sure I can’t make an abortion appointment? Isn’t there a loophole, an exception?” There are no abortion services at this clinic.",
            "Some callers were in denial. Some remained stoic, others cried. A few responded with hostility, insisting Fiddler was wrong. She tried to be polite, empathetic — but the conversations take a toll.",
            "“It frustrates me,” she said. “I’m already stressed out and upset. I understand wanting to find a way, but there’s no way.”",
            "As one of the first workers patients see, Fiddler takes pride in making people feel welcome and safe. Having to turn them away and simply refer them to a website is gutting, she said.",
            "“As helpless as I feel about it, I can’t imagine how they must be feeling,” she said.",
            "Outside the clinic, it’s quiet, too. There’s no buzz of patients arriving in the parking lot to be escorted by volunteers in pink vests. The only cars belong to staffers and a security guard. Across the street, a lot owned by an anti-abortion organization is vacant except for a large white cross.",
            "A regular protestor, a pastor with a “Jesus Loves You” sign, prayed outside a few early mornings, but the usual crowd pleading with patients to reconsider is gone. Some cars slow as they pass. Workers recognize some as protestors’ vehicles, and they imagine the clinic is being watched — to make sure patients aren’t arriving for abortions.",
            "Director Quiñonez said she knows the next steps will be challenging, with a long road for workers to recover from pain.",
            "“Our staff need space and time to process this very traumatic loss,” she said. “And all of the secondary trauma that we’re experiencing from all of the patients.”",
            "Simply being at work is hard, but the employees are dedicated to helping patients.",
            "“We came in Monday and I was kind of like, ‘OK, what do I do now?’” said Kaylen Barker, who handles the clinic's public messaging. “It's somber to come back here and realize we're not going to be able to do the lifesaving care that people need and that we're going to have to refer them to websites. That’s the best thing we can do right now.”",
            "Barker came to the clinic as a patient during a breast cancer scare 12 years ago. She got care when she had no other options. She knew she wanted to work at this place that helped save her, so she applied until she was finally hired. Knowing she can help others like her keeps her going, whether abortions are scheduled or not: “People deserve to receive healthcare in a welcoming space, without bias or judgement.”",
            "So Quiñonez and her staff focus on keeping the clinic open. Abortion services account for 40% of clinic revenue, leaving a gap that could mean layoffs — but Quiñonez is determined to avoid that.",
            "She's encouraging residents to transfer their gynecological care to the clinic, and she plans to offer new services. The clinic recently added gender-affirming hormone therapy services, along with HIV prevention and treatment. She hopes more programs will follow.",
            "And donations are flooding into the clinic's abortion fund. Before this year, the fund's balance never exceeded $50,000. In one weekend after the ruling, they raised $75,000. Staff will use the money to help send people out of state for abortions.",
            "“Yes, we are tired, we are devastated, we are angry,” Quiñonez said. \"But this is far from over. I want to reassure people that regardless of how hopeless and dark it feels right now, this isn’t the end.”"

            "A 10-year-old girl just over six weeks pregnant had to travel to Indiana to obtain an abortion after she was denied the procedure in her home state of Ohio, the Indianapolis Star Tribune reported Saturday.",
            "The appalling situation for the child rape victim will likely be repeated countless times now that the U.S. Supreme Court last month eradicated the half-century-old right to an abortion by reversing Roe v. Wade. States are now allowed to ban the procedure.",
            "The girl was referred for an abortion on Monday, three days after the Roe decision, to Indianapolis obstetrician-gynecologist Dr. Caitlin Bernard, she told the Indy Star. Bernard had been contacted by a colleague, a child abuse doctor in Ohio, who had determined that the girl was six weeks and three days pregnant, according to the newspaper.",
            "The girl was soon en route to Bernard’s care. There were no other details about her situation.",
            "Ohio prohibits an abortion when so-called fetal cardiac activity begins, around six weeks. Several groups filed a lawsuit seeking to block the state law from taking effect on Wednesday. But an emergency stay of the abortion ban was rejected by the Ohio Supreme Court Friday, which means the ban can be upheld while the case is being reviewed, the Cincinnati Enquirer reported.",
            "Future sexual assault victims like the 10-year-old will likely soon not have the option to travel to Indiana for an abortion.",

            "WASHINGTON (AP) —Abortion, guns and religion — a major change in the law in any one of these areas would have made for a fateful Supreme Court term. In its first full term together, the court’s conservative majority ruled in all three and issued other significant decisions limiting the government’s regulatory powers.",
            "And it has signaled no plans to slow down.",
            "With three appointees of former President Donald Trump in their 50s, the six-justice conservative majority seems poised to keep control of the court for years to come, if not decades.",
            "“This has been a revolutionary term in so many respects,” said Tara Leigh Grove, a law professor at the University of Texas. “The court has massively changed constitutional law in really big ways.”",
            "Its remaining opinions issued, the court began its summer recess Thursday, and the justices will next return to the courtroom in October.",
            "Overturning Roe v. Wade and ending a nearly half-century guarantee of abortion rights had the most immediate impact, shutting down or severely restricting abortions in roughly a dozen states within days of the decision.",
            "In expanding gun rights and finding religious discrimination in two cases, the justices also made it harder to sustain gun control laws and lowered barriers to religion in public life.",
            "Setting important new limits on regulatory authority, they reined in the government’s ability to fight climate change and blocked a Biden administration effort to get workers at large companies vaccinated against COVID-19.",
            "The remarkable week at the end of June in which the guns, abortion, religion and environmental cases were decided at least partially obscured other notable events, some of them troubling.",
            "New Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson was sworn in Thursday as the first Black woman on the court. She replaced the retiring Justice Stephen Breyer, who served nearly 28 years, a switch that won’t change the balance between liberals and conservatives on the court.",
            "In early May, the court had to deal with the unprecedented leak of a draft opinion in the abortion case. Chief Justice John Roberts almost immediately ordered an investigation, about which the court has been mum ever since. Soon after, workers encircled the court with 8-foot-high fencing in response to security concerns. In June, police made a late-night arrest of an armed man near Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s Maryland home, and charged him with attempted murder of the justice.",
            "Kavanaugh is one of three Trump appointees along with Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett who fortified the right side of the court. Greg Garre, who served as former President George W. Bush’s top Supreme Court lawyer, said when the court began its term in October “the biggest question was not so much which direction the court was headed in, but how fast it was going. The term answers that question pretty resoundingly, which is fast.”",
            "The speed also revealed that the chief justice no longer has the control over the court he held when he was one of five, not six, conservatives, Garre said.",
            "Roberts, who favors a more incremental approach that might bolster perceptions of the court as a nonpolitical institution, broke most notably with the other conservatives in the abortion case, writing that it was unnecessary to overturn Roe, which he called a “serious jolt” to the legal system. On the other hand, he was part of every other ideologically divided majority.",
            "If the past year revealed limits on the chief justice’s influence, it also showcased the sway of Justice Clarence Thomas, the longest-serving member of the court. He wrote the decision expanding gun rights and the abortion case marked the culmination of his 30-year effort on the Supreme Court to get rid of Roe, which had stood since 1973.",
            "Abortion is just one of several areas in which Thomas is prepared to jettison court precedents. The justices interred a second of their decisions, Lemon v. Kurtzman, in ruling for a high school football coach’s right pray on the 50-yard line following games. It’s not clear, though, that other justices are as comfortable as Thomas in overturning past decisions.",
            "The abortion and guns cases also seemed contradictory to some critics in that the court handed states authority over the most personal decisions, but limited state power in regulating guns. One distinction the majorities in those cases drew, though, is that the Constitution explicitly mentions guns, but not abortion.",
            "Those decisions do not seem especially popular with the public, according to opinion polls. Polls show a sharp drop in the court’s approval rating and in people’s confidence in the court as an institution.",
            "Justices on courts past have acknowledged a concern about public perception. As recently as last September, Justice Amy Coney Barrett said, “My goal today is to convince you that this court is not comprised of a bunch of partisan hacks.” Barrett spoke in at a center named for Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who engineered her rapid confirmation in 2020 and was sitting on the stage near the justice.",
            "But the conservatives, minus Roberts, rejected any concern about perception in the abortion case, said Grove, the University of Texas professor.",
            "Justice Samuel Alito wrote in his majority opinion that “not only are we not going to focus on that, we should not focus on that,” she said. “I’m sympathetic as an academic, but I was surprised to see that coming from that many real-world justices.”",
            "The liberal justices, though, wrote repeatedly that the court’s aggressiveness in this epic term was doing damage to the institution. Justice Sonia Sotomayor described her fellow justices as “a restless and newly constituted Court.” Justice Elena Kagan, in her abortion dissent, wrote: “The Court reverses course today for one reason and one reason only: because the composition of this Court has changed.”",
            "In 18 decisions, at least five conservative justices joined to form a majority and all three liberals were in dissent, roughly 30% of all the cases the court heard in its term that began last October.",
            "Among these, the court also:",
            "— Made it harder for people to sue state and federal authorities for violations of constitutional rights.",
            "— Raised the bar for defendants asserting their rights were violated, ruling against a Michigan man who was shackled at trial.",
            "— Limited how some death row inmates and others sentenced to lengthy prison terms can pursue claims that their lawyers did a poor job representing them.",
            "In emergency appeals, also called the court’s “shadow” docket because the justices often provide little or no explanation for their actions, the conservatives ordered the use of congressional districts for this year’s elections in Alabama and Louisiana even though lower federal courts have found they likely violated the federal Voting Rights Act by diluting the power of Black voters.",
            "The justices will hear arguments in the Alabama case in October, among several high-profile cases involving race or elections, or both.",
            "Also when the justices resume hearing arguments the use of race as a factor in college admissions is on the table, just six years after the court reaffirmed its permissibility. And the court will consider a controversial Republican-led appeal that would vastly increase the power of state lawmakers over federal elections, at the expense of state courts.",
            "These and cases on the intersection of LGBTQ and religious rights and another major environmental case involving development and water pollution also are likely to result in ideologically split decisions.",
            "Khiara Bridges, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, law school, drew a link between the voting rights and abortion cases. In the latter, Alito wrote in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization that abortion should be decided by elected officials, not judges.",
            "“I find it to be incredibly disingenuous for Alito to suggest that all that Dobbs is doing is returning this question to the states and that people can battle in the state about whether to protect fetal life or the interest of the pregnant person,” Bridges said. “But that same court is actively involved in insuring that states can disenfranchise people.”",
            "Bridges also said the outcomes aligned almost perfectly with the political aims of Republicans. “Whatever the Republican party wants, the Republican party is going to get out of the currently constituted court,” she said.",
            "Defenders of the court’s decisions said the criticism misses the mark because it confuses policy with law. “Supreme Court decisions are often not about what the policy should be, but rather about who (or which level of government, or which institution) should make the policy,” Princeton University political scientist Robert George wrote on Twitter.",
            "For now, there is no sign that either the justices or Republican and conservative interests that have brought so many of the high-profile cases to the court intend to trim their sails, Grove said.",
            "That’s in part because there’s no realistic prospect of court reforms that would limit the cases the justices could hear, impose term limits or increase the size of the Supreme Court, said Grove, who served on President Joe Biden’s bipartisan Supreme Court commission on court reforms.",

            "UVALDE, Texas (AP) — The Uvalde school district’s police chief has stepped down from his position in the City Council just weeks after being sworn in following allegations that he erred in his response to the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School that left 19 students and two teachers dead.",
            "Chief Pete Arredondo told the Uvalde Leader-News on Friday that has decided to step down for the good of the city administration. He was elected to the District 3 council position on May 7 and was sworn in — in a closed-door ceremony — on May 31, just a week after the massacre.",
            "“After much consideration, I regret to inform those who voted for me that I have decided to step down as a member of the city council for District 3. The mayor, the city council, and the city staff must continue to move forward without distractions. I feel this is the best decision for Uvalde,” Arredondo said.",
            "Arredondo, who has been on administrative leave from the school district since June 22, has declined repeated requests for comment from The Associated Press. His attorney, George Hyde, did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment Saturday.",
            "Col. Steven McCraw, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, told a state Senate hearing last month that Arredondo — the on-site commander — made “terrible decisions” as the massacre unfolded on May 24 , and that the police response was an “abject failure.”",
            "Three minutes after 18-year-old Salvador Ramos entered the school, sufficient armed law enforcement were on scene to stop the gunman, McCraw testified. Yet police officers armed with rifles stood and waited in a school hallway for more than an hour while the gunman carried out the massacre. The classroom door could not be locked from the inside, but there is no indication officers tried to open the door while the gunman was inside, McCraw said.",
            "McCraw has said parents begged police outside the school to move in and students inside the classroom repeatedly pleaded with 911 operators for help while more than a dozen officers waited in a hallway. Officers from other agencies urged Arredondo to let them move in because children were in danger.",
            "“The only thing stopping a hallway of dedicated officers from entering room 111 and 112 was the on-scene commander who decided to place the lives of officers before the lives of children,” McCraw said.",
            "Arredondo has tried to defend his actions, telling the Texas Tribune that he didn’t consider himself the commander in charge of operations and that he assumed someone else had taken control of the law enforcement response.

            "A Florida pediatrician has been booted off a state-appointed public health board of directors for statements about COVID-19 vaccines that displeased at least one Republican elected official.",
            "The pediatrician, Dr. Lisa Gwynn, had been advocating for equal access to the vaccine for children under 5 years old at a time when the state of Florida was running counter to health advice from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Florida is the only state that has not ordered vaccines for young children, despite the CDC’s recommendation that children under 5 be given the shots to protect against severe illness and death by the coronavirus.",
            "Gwynn’s medical recommendation provoked a harsh response from Florida’s chief financial officer, Jimmy Petronis, an ally of the state’s hard-right Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), who has peddled misleading information about the vaccines and encouraged residents to do their own research on the pandemic. Both men are up for reelection this year.",
            "The doctor was removed Wednesday from her position on the board of directors of the Florida Healthy Kids Corporation, a state health insurance provider, after being appointed several months earlier.",
            "Petronis’ deputy chief of staff, Susan Miller, told Gwynn in an email viewed by HuffPost that she had made “some very political statements that do not reflect the CFO’s point of view.”",
            "Gwynn told HuffPost she received no prior warning or offer to discuss the situation.",
            "Miller accused the doctor of “going so far as to say that the state is ‘obstruct[ing]’ access to vaccines,” an apparent reference to a June 17 press release from the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
            "Gwynn, who is president of the FCAAP, is quoted as saying, “The state’s decision to obstruct access to COVID-19 vaccines is anti-science, an affront to parental rights, and an intrusion into the relationship between doctors, patients, and the families they serve.”",
            "In the U.S., coronavirus vaccine distribution is done on a state-by-state basis, with state leaders putting in large orders for the drugs on behalf of localized health care providers. Because DeSantis refuses to put in an order for Florida, parents of young kids in the state are limited in where they can go to get the shots, the FCAAP says.",
            "Miller went on: “The CFO does not share your opinion and believes that the state has gone to great lengths to protect lives in the face of the Coronavirus.”",

            "Gwynn called the decision “disappointing” in a tweet.",

            "With COVID, mass shootings, monkeypox, the fall of abortion rights, racially fueled hate crimes and the exploding mental health crisis ― just to name a few ― it can really feel like we’re stuck in a black hole of bad news.",
            "There is only so much trauma a person can take before it starts to chip away at their mental and physical health. When you’re exposed to constant stressors, as we’ve all been over the past few years, it’s natural to experience compassion fatigue, a type of empathy burnout that can occur after being excessively exposed to negative events. Compassion fatigue looks a bit different from person to person but often leaves people feeling exhausted, detached, emotionally disconnected and helpless. For example, maybe you find yourself feeling less affected by horrific shootings, or perhaps you feel indifferent to protests on reproductive justice or unable to help people living in Ukraine. Compassion fatigue is real, and it’s no surprise that so many people are experiencing it after enduring an extreme amount of pain, rage, disbelief and worry on multiple fronts.",
            "Compassion fatigue also doesn’t happen overnight. It takes weeks, sometimes months or years, to take hold. By the time most people recognize they’re struggling, it’s fully surfaced.",
            "“Usually we’re gradually shifting into this state of becoming less and less capable of coping with the stress of new events, and therefore, when we get big news — like what happened with the most recent ruling on abortion — we might not really have the emotional reserve to cope with such big news,” Sheehan D. Fisher, an associate professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine, told HuffPost.",
            "Here are a few signs you might be dealing with compassion fatigue:",
            "A shift in your mood",
            "Some people may start to notice a difference in their moods and feel more agitated or irritable on a daily basis. Those with compassion fatigue tend to develop a more pessimistic view of the world and begin to lack hope about the future.",
            "There’s “just feeling generally unhappy or apathetic or having difficulty in maintaining compassion or empathy in a way that is typical for you,” explained Jessica Stern, a clinical assistant professor in the department of psychiatry at New York University’s Langone Health.",
            "Compassion fatigue may also cause changes in cognitive function, affecting people’s ability to think clearly, make decisions and use good judgment, research shows.",
            "Feeling fatigued or burned out",
            "When you are repeatedly exposed to trauma and are chronically in a fight-or-flight state, it’s typical to experience intense exhaustion and fatigue, Stern said. In the beginning, compassion fatigue can feel like a roller coaster, with dips of intense stress and depletion.",
            "But over time, depletion will take over and set in. “With time, you’re going to find that the ‘on moments’ are going to become diluted more and more and more, where you’re just going to feel the low end of that, which is exhaustion and fatigue,” Stern said.",
            "This is more common in people who feel like they lack agency over what’s occurring in their life. “The more that they feel that they don’t have a way to fix the problem and that there’s just a problem that’s unresolvable, it’s more likely for them to start to feel fatigued by it because they don’t feel like there’s a way to make change that they have control of,” Fisher said.",
            "Becoming disengaged from things that once mattered",
            "Compassion fatigue can cause people to avoid situations that may normally cause them to feel stress or even compassion, according to Fisher.",
            "Because they have already met their limit of what they can handle emotionally, it can feel like a burden to put themselves in yet another situation that would bring on more stress. As a result, people may become disconnected from their social networks and lose touch with the activities that previously brought them joy.",
            "Feeling desensitized or complacent",
            "Over time, this disengagement can turn into complacency. People can become desensitized to negative events and lose the ability to feel empathetic or sympathetic. They may develop a more muted response to stressors because they’re so burned out from their ability to engage, Fisher said. Eventually they may completely shut down emotionally.",
            "“What we worry about sometimes is people become so complacent that they walk away from dealing with problems in general,” Fisher said.",
            "Here’s how to cope with compassion fatigue",
            "Stern recommends first identifying where you feel depleted — whether that’s at work, at home, in your social life or with sleeping and eating. Notice what in your life might be contributing to your fatigue. Focus on the small things that you can control, Stern says. Start there and see if that helps, then begin to make bigger changes.",
            "Although it’s important to be aware of what’s happening in the world, overexposure can be more harmful than helpful. In some cases, it can create the reverse result, and people may become inactive or disengaged with the problem, according to Fisher. “Limiting how much we are exposed to to make it functional for the goal is important,” Fisher said.",
            "Self-care is also crucial and can include things like reaching out to your support system, exercising, resting and taking care of your physical health. All of that can help you cope with the stress of life events.",
            "Fisher recommends approaching your recovery as you would a big lifestyle change. “They need to maintain a certain level of well-being and a certain level of self-insight into their emotional health to know how much they can take on, or not, and know when it’s safe to take on more,” Fisher said.",
            "If you are able to make substantial changes and adjust the factors that have been contributing to your compassion fatigue, you will likely be able to recover quicker, Stern added.",
            "It takes time to recover from compassion fatigue — a couple of weeks if not a couple of months, according to Stern. If you try these things and the fatigue persists or worsens, it’s worth talking to a therapist or psychiatrist who can assess whether you’re experience compassion fatigue or perhaps a more serious issue."

            "LONDON (AP) — The British monarchy’s publicly-funded spending rose by 17% to 102.4 million pounds ($124 million) in the past year, with the renovation of Buckingham Palace taking up a large part of the expenses, royal accounts published Thursday showed.",
            "The palace’s annual Sovereign Grant report showed that royal spending went up by 14.9 million pounds compared to the previous year.",
            "Critics described the spending as excessive amid Britain’s cost-of-living crisis.",
            "Property maintenance accounted for a big chunk of the spending — about 64 million pounds — because of a 10-year project to overhaul pipes, wiring and electricals at Buckingham Palace.",
            "Costs for official tours also went up, as the royals returned to making overseas visits after the lifting of coronavirus restrictions.",
            "The most expensive official royal tour in the past year was the trip taken by Prince William and his wife, Kate Middleton, to the Caribbean in March that cost about 226,000 pounds.",
            "The trip, meant to boost Commonwealth ties, was instead marred by protests, calls for slavery reparations, and photo opportunities criticized as a throwback to colonialism.",
            "The Sovereign Grant is public funding to support the official duties of Queen Elizabeth II and other costs such as official travel, staff for working royals and the upkeep of occupied palaces.",
            "The amount of the grant — 86.3 million pounds in 2021-22 — is based on a proportion of profits from the Crown Estate, a vast collection of property across the U.K. The amount is equivalent to costing 1.29 pounds per person in the country.",
            "Britain’s royals also have other sources of income, including from tourists paying to visit royal palaces.",
            "The Daily Mirror tabloid questioned the royal spending on its front page with a headline reading: “£100M for the royals? Record payout for The Firm as nation feels pinch.” And anti-monarchy campaign group Republic said the expenditure was too much.",
            "“As always, while the rest of us face a cost-of-living crisis and continued squeezes on public services, the royals walk off with hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money,” the group’s chief executive Graham Smith said.",
            "Palace officials have said Prince Charles and the royal family pay close attention to rapidly soaring living costs and are “extremely conscious” of the crisis.",
            "The annual financial report was published amid heightened scrutiny of Charles’ finances, with recent news reports claiming the heir to the throne had been given millions of pounds in cash in a suitcase and carrier bags by the former prime minister of Qatar.",
            "The Sunday Times reported the prince was given a total of 3 million euros ($3.2 million) by Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani. Charles’ office said the donations were “passed immediately” to one of the prince’s charities and that “appropriate governance” was carried out.",
            "The newspaper did not allege that anything illegal was done, and Charles’ office denied any wrongdoing.",
            "Still, Charles’ spokespeople said Wednesday: “that is then and this is now,” stressing he would never again handle large cash donations.",
            "“For more than half a decade, with the situation as it has evolved, this has not happened and it would not happen again,” a palace official who was not named in line with palace policy told British media.",

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the decision and was joined by fellow conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh as well as the court’s three liberal justices — Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.",

But lower courts ordered it reinstated in response to a lawsuit from Republican-led Texas and Missouri. The current administration has sent far fewer people back to Mexico than did the Trump administration.",
            "The heart of the legal fight was about whether immigration authorities, with far less detention capacity than needed, had to send people to Mexico or whether they had the discretion under federal law to release asylum-seekers into the United States while they awaited their hearings.",
            "About 70,000 people were enrolled in the program, formally known as Migrant Protection Protocols, after President Donald Trump launched it in 2019 and made it a centerpiece of efforts to deter asylum-seekers.",
            "After Biden’s suspension of the program, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas ended it in June 2021. In October, the department produced additional justifications for the policy’s demise, to no avail in the courts.",

            "A Florida judge ruled Thursday that the family of Gabby Petito may proceed with a civil lawsuit against Brian Laundrie’s parents, whom they say caused them emotional distress by hiding that their son had killed their daughter last year on a van trip across America.",
            "Judge Hunter Carroll of the 12th Circuit Court of Florida ruled on the matter after Chris and Roberta Laundrie, Brian’s parents, requested that the lawsuit seeking damages of at least $100,000 be thrown out, saying they had no obligation to speak to law enforcement or the Petito family about what happened.",
            "Though that may be true, Carroll ruled, the Petito family may still seek damages over the comments the family did make.",
            "“If the facts of this case were truly about silence with no affirmative action by the Laundries, the court would have resolved this case in the Laundries’ favor on the concept of legal duty, or more precisely, the lack of legal duty for the Laundries to act,” Carroll wrote in his decision. “Had the Laundries truly stayed silent, the court would have granted the motion to dismiss in the Laundries’ favor. But they did not stay silent.”",
            "He emphasized a statement the Laundries released on Sept. 14, 2021 ― more than two weeks after Gabby was strangled to death and days before authorities found her body in Wyoming’s Grand Teton National Park. The Petitos allege in their lawsuit that Brian Laundrie, who killed himself after he returned to Florida, had already told his parents about killing Petito at the time they released the remarks.",
            "The statement read: “It is our understanding that a search has been organized for Miss Petito in or near Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming. On behalf of the Laundrie family, it is our hope that the search for Miss Petito is successful and that Miss Petito is reunited with her family.”",
            "If the Laundries did in fact know at the time that their son had killed the Petitos’ daughter, Carroll wrote, “then the Laundries’ statement was particularly callous and cruel, and it is sufficiently outrageous to state claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress.”",
            "The Laundrie family’s lawyer, Steven Bertolino, said in a statement that his clients “are disappointed with Judge Carroll’s decision to deny the motion and allow this lawsuit to proceed.”",
            "Patrick Reilly, a lawyer for the Petito family, said his clients are “appreciative of the thorough and well-reasoned decision” by Carroll and are hopeful a trial will uncover “any correspondence, emails and texts exchanged during the difficult period when Gabby’s whereabouts were unknown.”",
            "Carroll’s ruling comes a week after the Laundrie family’s lawyer released a copy of the handwritten pages from a notebook in which their 23-year-old son confessed to killing Petito, his 22-year-old fiancée with whom he was on an extended, multi-state road trip last summer, which they were documenting on social media. He claimed in the notebook that she had sustained injuries while they were in the wilderness and that he “thought it was merciful” to end her life.",
            "After the events described in the notebook, Laundrie returned home to Florida alone and spent several days with his family before embarking on a hike in a nearby wilderness area and taking his own life with a gun. Authorities found his body in October.",
            "Investigators have not released any findings showing that Petito suffered from any serious injuries aside from strangulation. Her family said last week that the claims in the notebook are “nonsense.”"

            "Meghan Markle said in a new interview with Vogue that both she and Prince Harry had a “guttural” reaction to the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade last week.",
            "“Men need to be vocal in this moment and beyond because these are decisions that affect relationships, families, and communities at large,” Meghan said during the interview, in conversation with News Not Noise founder Jessica Yellin and longtime women’s rights advocate Gloria Steinem.",
            "“They may target women, but the consequences impact all of us,” the royal said. “My husband and I talked about that a lot over the past few days. He’s a feminist too.”",
            "“And his reaction last week was guttural, like mine. I know that for so many women right now, there is a sentiment of despair. But again, we have to band together and not wallow. We have to do the work.”",
            "The Supreme Court struck down the decades-old precedent protecting abortion rights on Friday, setting into effect trigger laws in some states that immediately banned abortion.",
            "Meghan spoke to Vogue about how the decision will impact those without resources and women of color, who already face high mortality rates in pregnancy alone.",
            "“It’s difficult to overstate what this decision is going to do to these communities,” the duchess said. “This moment requires unity — really listening to people, understanding the Constitution was written at a time when women were second-class citizens,” she added. “We’re not. Certain things need to change.”",
            "Meghan also spoke of a possible future trip to D.C. with Steinem.The Duchess of Sussex has become even more involved in U.S. issues since stepping back as a working member of the royal family in March 2020.She has advocated on behalf of parental leave in a letter and calls to politicians last year. In May, she expressed her support for a new child care initiative through the National Business Coalition for Child Care.During her time as a royal, she reportedly spoke about her views on abortion in 2018. Irish lawmaker Catherine Noone tweeted out a conversation she had with Meghan at the time, amidst the country’s campaign to repeal the country’s ban on abortions, and said that the duchess supported Ireland’s decision to legalize abortion. Kensington Palace would not comment to HuffPost on Meghan’s reported conversation at the time."

            "A Texas mother who said she ran into the Uvalde elementary school mass shooting to rescue her two young sons as law enforcement officers stood outside has been harassed by police and plans to take legal action, her attorney said.",
            "“As far as we know there’s two definite instances,” Angeli Rose Gomez’s attorney, Mark Di Carlo, told HuffPost of the hostility he said she’s experienced after defying officers’ orders and running into Robb Elementary School during the May 24 massacre to save her children.",
            "Gomez, who said she was briefly handcuffed by police outside the school, has publicly criticized officers for failing to immediately enter the building and confront the gunman who killed 19 children and two adults. Officers waited for 70 minutes before storming the classroom and killing the shooter — a response the Texas public safety chief has called an “abject failure.”",
            "“She did act in a very brave manner,” said Di Carlo, who said he’s representing about 15 members of the Uvalde community. “I have it corroborated from at least two people that she did go into the school, she did jump the fence, she was handcuffed. I don’t believe that any officers were in that school until she went in and then they followed her in.”",
            "Di Carlo said Gomez believes she has since been targeted by police. She was pulled over for a traffic stop and falsely accused of having illegal immigrants in her vehicle, he said. About a week ago, a police vehicle parked outside of her home for about 45 minutes and flashed its lights at her and her mother while they were going for a walk.",
            "Di Carlo said he wrote to the Uvalde Police Department about what happened, but has not received a response.",
            "In another incident, he said a family member of Gomez said police instructed them to tell Gomez to stop speaking to the media about the massacre. That incident may be harder to prove, he said, but a Philadelphia nonprofit civil rights group has offered to file a freedom of speech lawsuit on Gomez’s behalf.",
            "In a statement to HuffPost on Thursday, the city of Uvalde denied that its officers have harassed her or that anyone with the Uvalde Police Department placed her in handcuffs on the day of the shooting. The city said that its officers have had interactions with Gomez in the weeks since, claiming she was accused of causing a disturbance at a relative’s home and refusing to leave, and that she later called police over a child custody issue. It also supplied police reports that said she was cited for drug paraphernalia possession following a traffic stop.",
            "Di Carlo, responding to those allegations Thursday, called the paraphernalia charge, without an accompanying drug charge, highly unusual and “a further example of harassment.” He repeated that he has still not heard back from the Uvalde Police Department about his concerns.",
            "Di Carlo, in his earlier interview, said other community members also have expressed anger and frustration about officers’ behavior during the shooting. Before engaging the gunman, he said, the cops used taxpayer-funded resources to block parents from rescuing their children.",
            "Video taken outside of the school shows parents screaming and begging officers to enter the school as the violence unfolded.",
            "“The police were basically acting in an abusive manner towards the people outside who were concerned about the children,” Di Carlo said. Gomez, he said, “was basically falsely arrested or falsely imprisoned, though momentarily, to prevent her from going into the school.”",
            "Di Carlo said his office intends to file at least one lawsuit related to the massacre, likely targeting government and law enforcement agencies. Before that filing, he hopes to examine the shooter’s purchase of an AR-15-style assault rifle and the school building, including the door the killer entered.",
            "Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin last week said the school will be torn down, but didn’t say when. Di Carlo said he has contacted the Texas Department of Public Safety and hopes to investigate first.",
            "“That school is evidence,” Di Carlo said, and destroying it could make legal claims harder to pursue."

        "news_article": [
            "As the culture reckons with the ills of the ’80s and ’90s, much of the focus has been on how both the public and the media treated white American female stars like Britney Spears. That’s a necessary conversation, but there’s a parallel discussion we haven’t really had ― about the ways in which we participated in, rubber-stamped and effectively overlooked the exploitative nature of boy bands, particularly those whose members didn’t primarily speak English.",
            "That makes watching HBO Max’s “Menudo: Forever Young” a sobering experience. The docuseries compels you to understand how one of the most beloved boy bands ever, made up of preteen and teenage boys from Puerto Rico, was commodified for our consumption and enjoyment. It does this unapologetically and, especially in the beginning, largely in Spanish.",
            "“Not like we cared,” co-director Krístofer Ríos told HuffPost ― though he admitted he had some anxiety about how audiences would receive the series, partly because it’s in both Spanish and English. “I mean, we first and foremost made this for Puerto Ricans. But you want a wider audience to see this.”",
            "It’s actually imperative that we do. As you process each segment ― there are four parts to the series, each one about an hour ― you begin to realize the parallels to our relationships with all boy bands across history and language, from the Jackson 5 and ’N Sync to BTS.",
            "Ríos believes that the obsession with the business of male youth and talent began with Menudo. “It is the first time in which the industry realizes this is a way for us to maximize profit from five boys,” he said. “Menudo is the first to show the world [that] this is how you make a lot of money off of five young men. We’re really analyzing the way in which the industry exploits boys for profit.”",
            "That means telling the full story of Menudo, as few have ever bothered to do. Most of the band’s superfans could probably recite the press-release version of their story by heart: Edgardo Díaz created the band in the ’70s in Puerto Rico. They earned international adoration with hits like “Los Fantasmas” in the early ’80s, which helped solidify their status as teen idols in both their native island and the United States throughout the early 2000s.",
            "Even if you didn’t have “Menuditis” ― a word that stans came up with to describe their love for five of the most recognizable boys in the world ― Menudo was impossible to ignore completely.",
            "Ríos was born in New York and moved to Puerto Rico when he was 4. He lived there until he was 14. He knew Menudo’s songs, and who they were. “I remember when I was a kid, you go to birthday parties and they give you the little Menudo vanity mirror and fanny pack and the Menudo notebook and that kind of stuff,” he recalled. “I think I might have even had a Menudo T-shirt.”",
            "That’s the narrative that everyone knew, even if they were only marginally aware of Menudo — and if you were a fan of any boy band, you could certainly relate to the fascination with merch. To Ríos and co-director Angel Manuel Soto’s credit, they tell a nuanced story that delves into why the group was, and still is, so cherished. In doing so, they knew they had to talk about the cost of the fame and respect that these boys helped bring back to Puerto Rico.",
            "Featuring clips and interviews with about 12 members of the band as well as other experts, “Menudo: Forever Young” also details the parts of their story that haven’t been appropriately accounted for, even all these years later.",
            "For example: how Díaz replaced each boy once they hit puberty to maintain the youthfulness of the group, giving the outgoing member little if any notice. How the boys allegedly weren’t adequately paid for the round-the-clock work they did. How they were robbed of an education due to aggressive touring and rehearsal schedules. How their parents had to sign over a substantial portion of their parental rights to Díaz, so he could manage them as he saw fit. And how they had very little actual supervision, making the minors vulnerable to the drugs that were everywhere.",
            "But arguably the most devastating part of the story is the band members’ allegations that Díaz groomed and sexually abused them.",
            "That caught even Ríos off guard. The filmmaker came to the project with an extensive journalism background and did plenty of research on the band. “I didn’t know that there were abuse allegations,” he said. “The things you see in the documentary — I didn’t know. My first time engaging with those parts of the story was when I started working on the project.”",
            "As “Menudo: Forever Young” shows, though, it’s not like these claims weren’t made public, even at the height of the band’s success. Journalists like Carmen Jovet and Juan González rang alarms about this story years ago, largely to no avail.",
            "Similarly, band member Ralphy Rodríguez publicly accused Díaz of abuse in 1991. That was on the wildly popular Univision talk show “El show de Cristina,” whose host, Cristina Saralegui, also invited the much more powerful Díaz on the episode to counter Rodríguez’s claims.",
            "So the allegations were there. But, like we’ve seen so many times when it comes to pop stars and other celebrities, there were overwhelming incentives for the media and the entertainment industry to distort or gloss over these details and keep the boy-band machine running. (Díaz has not commented on the docuseries, but has denied previous allegations against him.)",
            "Fans often ignore this kind of information because they want to preserve the purity of their love for the band, or they feel too uncomfortable to confront it, or they simply don’t care either way — or a combination of all these things. That’s not even disrupted by the obvious fact that their favorite members were regularly rotated out of the group like baseball cards.",
            "Ríos admits he was a bit nervous as he approached this minefield of complex storytelling, but he knew it was necessary. “There’s that layer of us challenging the culture of pop-stardom boy bands,” he said. “But we’re [also] challenging the culture in our community and amongst Puerto Ricans that allowed these boys over many decades to go through this machine and be abused.”",
            "It’s tricky, and it means having to consider multiple truths at once. On one hand, the number of barriers the band broke for Puerto Ricans, as detailed in “Menudo: Forever Young,” cannot be overstated. This could have greatly overshadowed everything else.",
            "Ríos also notes how ignoring the members’ humanity when considering them or their success is a direct result of the boy band business model, an echo of how Motown — home of the Jackson 5, the Temptations and Boyz II Men — was itself a byproduct of the Detroit assembly line. That’s compounded by Puerto Rico’s complicated relationship with the U.S.",
            "“There’s a layer of the colonial status of Puerto Rico,” Ríos said. “It’s like if the assembly line at Ford removes the humanity of the worker, then what does a model like Menudo ― that’s pulling from the United States examples of how to do business ― then do?”",
            "He thought about that some more, before adding: “You’re not just removing their humanity. Also, there’s the layers of exploitation and injustice that I think that when you live in an economy, you replicate in your business models.”",
            "That’s working in tandem with the fact that in 1991, for instance, we did not have the language or the support to talk about things like sexual abuse and exploitation. Especially when systems like capitalism dominated the way we viewed the world, and particularly how we viewed fame.",
            "Ríos points to previous documentaries like “Leaving Neverland” and “Framing Britney Spears” ― which came out while he and Soto were working on their own series ― that show a shift in the way the public talks about celebrity allegations of abuse. “I think now in 2022, we have a wider understanding,” he said.",
            "“Walking away from [‘Framing Britney Spears’], I felt like I was guilty of not taking the story seriously because she’s Britney Spears and she’s a pop star,” Ríos said. “The same kind of misconceptions and prejudices, really, that people apply to the Menudo story.”",
            "But as compelling as “Menudo: Forever Young” is, there will still be people who question its veracity, despite all of the filmmakers’ research and effort and all the interviews they conducted during the making of the project. That might be exacerbated by the absence of Ricky Martin, one of the band’s most popular members.",
            "It doesn’t seem like Martin has really said anything in the past, or even since the release of this series, about his peers’ claims. Ríos didn’t get into a whole lot of details when he was asked about it, but he did say that Martin’s team was definitely contacted about him being a part of the project.",
            "“I will say that we tried very, very hard to have him participate in the project, and there was a serious consideration,” Ríos said.",
            "“There’s a few different factors — I mean, on the production side, we didn’t have enough time to accommodate,” he continued. “He’s a megastar, he’s on tour, he’s doing things. So we didn’t have unlimited time to make things work out on his schedule.”",
            "Fair enough. Still, when celebrities come forward with allegations of abuse, intense public skepticism is always a possibility ― as we saw just this month with Amber Heard’s trial and the vicious, insidious response to it. “I mean, we’re seeing these things happen over and over and over again,” Ríos said. “And we move forward a little bit. Then we take a couple steps back.”",
            "That seems to be where we remain as a culture. Many fans these days are grappling with complicated feelings, trying to sort through their love for certain pop culture entities as their narratives become more complex than they were ever marketed as. So where do we go from “Menudo: Forever Young”?",
            "For the answer, Ríos reflects fondly on everything Menudo gave to Puerto Ricans, who felt devalued before the band reached the highest heights. Menudo reminded them of who they are.",
            "“We finally felt like, ‘Hey, we belong here,’” Ríos said. “We can claim our space. We can be who we are. We can sing in Spanish. We can celebrate these guys and be ourselves, and that’s priceless. Feeling like you belong — it’s a huge gift that these guys gave to us.”",
            "And he wants viewers, particularly Menudo fans, to remember that as they watch this series.",
            "“I can’t thank these band members enough for enduring that stuff,” Ríos said. “But still doing it for us, for the culture. I don’t want fans to walk away from this and be like, ‘Oh, this was hard and maybe I shouldn’t have been a fan.’ No, absolutely you should have been a fan.”",

            "It had been a long time since Bookmarks, a nonprofit literary arts organization, was able to hold its normal programming in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. But as the staff began to feel more comfortable holding events during the coronavirus pandemic, they planned a Drag Queen Story Hour for last weekend. It was nothing particularly new, and they had hosted one before the pandemic, too.",
            "But what was supposed to be a way for children to learn and have some fun turned into an opportunity for conservative protesters to lob false, hurtful and dangerous accusations.",
            "A handful of protesters came out to Bookmarks, and while they were met with a much larger counter-protest, the nonprofit organization also received phone calls and emails from angry conservatives.",
            "“It’s just shocking to us the level of hatred we received,” Jamie Rogers Southern, the executive director of Bookmarks, told HuffPost. “It was an emotional week for us.”",
            "Southern said most of the callers were badly confused about drag shows. “A lot of it is unfortunately misguided and ill-informed statements about how drag queens were pornography or a strip show,” she said. The protesters were fully convinced that this was a publicly funded event, she said, and believed that kids would “become” transgender just from looking at a drag queen. (No tax dollars were used.)",
            "Bookmarks is not alone. Earlier this month, a drag queen story time in California was interrupted by the Proud Boys, an extremist hate group. Members of the group stormed the event and yelled homophobic and transphobic slurs. And Last weekend, members of the Proud Boys protested a drag queen story time at a library in Nevada. Parents and children ran into the building after a man allegedly pulled out a gun.",
            "The sudden backlash to previously uncontroversial events didn’t come out of nowhere. In the last few months, the conservative movement has doubled down on its attacks on queer people. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) revoked Disney World’s special tax status after the corporation released a statement in opposition to the state’s “Don’t Say Gay” bill, which is now law and restricts Florida teachers from talking about sexual orientation and gender in the classroom.",
            "In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott (R) ordered the state’s child protective services to investigate the parents of transgender children, claiming that getting their children’s gender-affirming care is tantamount to abuse.",
            "Republican leaders and activists are cloaking their homophobia and transphobia in concern for children. But behind every “Won’t somebody think of the kids?” wail is the real motivation: the desire to control and enforce strict gender roles.",
            "And family drag shows are the new catnip for this ultra-regressive movement.",
            "The protest in Winston-Salem came just weeks after a video of a similar confrontation in Dallas went viral.",
            "In the video, drag queens could be seen leading a group of kids down a makeshift runway, doing age-appropriate dances and poses while parents looked on and cheered.",
            "“Take your children to CHURCH, not drag bars,” Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) tweeted without a hint of acknowledgment of the child sexual abuse scandals at various churches.",
            "After the video went viral, DeSantis, who is well-versed in attacking the LGBTQ community, said that he would be open to having child protective services in his state investigate parents who take their children to drag shows.",
            "“It used to be kids would be off-limits. Used to be everybody agreed with that,” DeSantis said. “Now it just seems like there’s a concerted effort to be exposing kids more and more to things that are not age-appropriate.”",
            "Florida state Rep. Anthony Sabatini (R) tweeted that he would “be proposing Legislation to charge w/ a Felony & terminate the parental rights of any adult who brings a child to these perverted sex shows aimed at FL kids.”",
            "Elsewhere in Texas, state Rep. Bryan Slaton (R) tweeted that he would soon introduce a bill that would ban drag shows in the presence of children.",
            "“The events of this past weekend were horrifying and show a disturbing trend in which perverted adults are obsessed with sexualizing children,” he wrote in a press release. “As a father of two young children, I know I would never take my children to a drag show.”",
            "It’s unclear how a bill like this would work, or what it would entail. Would children be banned from watching “Mrs. Doubtfire”? The 1993 classic stars Robin Williams as a divorced dad who dresses in drag and poses as a housekeeper to remain close to his children. Or what about the Madea films, which famously star Tyler Perry as the matriarch of a large Black family?",
            "Because drag queens are a large part of the LGBTQ community, they’re automatically a part of the conservative culture war on anyone who isn’t straight, white and cisgender. And, as Republicans in power have made clear, those are the only type of people who are acceptable in their vision for America.",
            "In the same way attacks on critical race theory were posited as efforts to keep kids safe from discrimination, bloviating about storytime with drag queens as perverted is simply a cover for the real end goal.",
            "Conservatives conflate drag queens reading books to children with the sexualization of children because hypocrisy has no bounds. Elected officials have failed to act on school shootings, child hunger and countless other issues facing children today.",
            "Instead, they’re hyper-focused on the faux moral panic of drag queen storytime.",
            "But librarians and other organizations aren’t sitting back and watching. Alison Macrina, the director of the Library Freedom Project, held an informal session about attacks on libraries at the American Library Association’s annual conference over the weekend.",
            "There, attendees discussed preventative measures, actions to be taken the moment a library is targeted, and what the community can do in the aftermath.",
            "“There is a line between frightening people and readiness,” Macrina told HuffPost. “We discussed how to get parents organized around this, de-escalation training, and crisis intervention.” The hope is that library staff will be prepared to handle such situations — without involving the police, who aren’t always helpful when it comes to incidents like these.",
            "As the Proud Boys and other similar groups continue their attacks with the implicit support of elected officials, Macrina is urging people to get involved with their libraries and the broader community. “Get organized with your neighbors who believe in gay rights, trans rights and drag queen story time,” she said. “We really, really need your support.”"

            "WASHINGTON (AP) — Facebook and Instagram have begun promptly removing posts that offer abortion pills to women who may not be able to access them following a Supreme Court decision that stripped away constitutional protections for the procedure.",
            "Such social media posts ostensibly aimed to help women living in states where preexisting laws banning abortion suddenly snapped into effect on Friday. That’s when the high court overruled Roe v. Wade, its 1973 decision that declared access to abortion a constitutional right.",
            "Memes and status updates explaining how women could legally obtain abortion pills in the mail exploded across social platforms. Some even offered to mail the prescriptions to women living in states that now ban the procedure.",
            "Almost immediately, Facebook and Instagram began removing some of these posts, just as millions across the U.S. were searching for clarity around abortion access. General mentions of abortion pills, as well as posts mentioning specific versions such as mifepristone and misoprostol, suddenly spiked Friday morning across Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and TV broadcasts, according to an analysis by the media intelligence firm Zignal Labs.",
            "By Sunday, Zignal had counted more than 250,000 such mentions.",
            "The AP obtained a screenshot on Friday of one Instagram post from a woman who offered to purchase or forward abortion pills through the mail, minutes after the court ruled to overturn the constitutional right to an abortion.",
            "“DM me if you want to order abortion pills, but want them sent to my address instead of yours,” the post on Instagram read.",
            "Instagram took it down within moments. Vice Media first reported on Monday that Meta, the parent of both Facebook and Instagram, was taking down posts about abortion pills.",
            "On Monday, an AP reporter tested how the company would respond to a similar post on Facebook, writing: “If you send me your address, I will mail you abortion pills.”",
            "The post was removed within one minute.",
            "The Facebook account was immediately put on a “warning” status for the post, which Facebook said violated its standards on “guns, animals and other regulated goods.”",
            "Yet, when the AP reporter made the same exact post but swapped out the words “abortion pills” for “a gun,” the post remained untouched. A post with the same exact offer to mail “weed” was also left up and not considered a violation.",

            "BERLIN (AP) — A 101-year-old man was convicted in Germany of more than 3,500 counts of accessory to murder on Tuesday for serving at the Nazis’ Sachsenhausen concentration camp during World War II.",
            "The Neuruppin Regional Court sentenced him to five years in prison.",
            "The man, who was identified by local media as Josef S., had denied working as an SS guard at the camp and aiding and abetting the murder of thousands of prisoners.",
            "In the trial, which opened in October, the centenarian said that he had worked as a farm laborer near Pasewalk in northeastern Germany during the period in question.",
            "However, the court considered it proven that he worked at the camp on the outskirts of Berlin between 1942 and 1945 as an enlisted member of the Nazi Party’s paramilitary wing, the German news agency dpa reported.",
            "“The court has come to the conclusion that, contrary to what you claim, you worked in the concentration camp as a guard for about three years,” presiding Judge Udo Lechtermann said, according to dpa. He added that, in doing so, the defendant had assisted in the Nazis’ terror and murder mechanism.",
            "“You willingly supported this mass extermination with your activity,” Lechtermann said. “You watched deported people being cruelly tortured and murdered there every day for three years.”",
            "Prosecutors had based their case on documents relating to an SS guard with the man’s name, date and place of birth, as well as other documents.",
            "The five-year prison sentence was in line with the prosecution’s demand.",
            "The defendant’s lawyer had sought an acquittal. Defense attorney Stefan Waterkamp said after the pronouncement of the sentence that he would appeal the verdict, dpa reported.",
            "Germany’s leading Jewish group welcomed the ruling.",
            "“Even if the defendant will probably not serve the full prison sentence due to his advanced age, the verdict is to be welcomed,” said Josef Schuster, the head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany.",
            "“The thousands of people who worked in the concentration camps kept the murder machinery running. They were part of the system, so they should take responsibility for it,” Schuster added. “It is bitter that the defendant has denied his activities at that time until the end and has shown no remorse.”",
            "For practical reasons, the trial was held in a gymnasium in Brandenburg/Havel, the 101-year-old’s place of residence. The man was only fit to stand trial to a limited extent and was only able to participate in the trial for about two and a half hours each day. The process was interrupted several times for health reasons and hospital stays.",
            "Efraim Zuroff, the head Nazi hunter at the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s office in Jerusalem, told The Associated Press that the sentence “sends a message that if you commit such crimes, even decades later, you might be brought to justice.”",
            "“And it’s a very important thing because it gives closure to the relatives of the victims,” Zuroff added. “The fact that these people all of a sudden feel that their loss is being addressed and the suffering of their family who they lost in the camps is being addressed ... is a very important thing.”",
            "However, Zuroff expressed concern that S. might serve only part of the sentence or none at all because of his planned appeal and his advanced age.",
            "Sachsenhausen was established in 1936 just north of Berlin as the first new site after Adolf Hitler gave the SS full control of the Nazi concentration camp system. It was intended to be a model facility and training camp for the labyrinthine network that the Nazis built across Germany, Austria and occupied territories.",
            "More than 200,000 people were held there between 1936 and 1945. Tens of thousands of inmates died of starvation, disease, forced labor and other causes, as well as through medical experiments and systematic SS extermination operations including shootings, hangings and gassing.",
            "Exact numbers on those killed vary, with upper estimates of some 100,000, though scholars suggest figures of 40,000 to 50,000 are likely more accurate.",
            "In its early years, most inmates were either political prisoners or criminal convicts, but they also included some Jehovah’s Witnesses and homosexuals. The first large group of Jewish prisoners was brought there in 1938 after the so-called Night of Broken Glass, or Kristallnacht, an antisemitic pogrom.",
            "During the war, Sachsenhausen was expanded to include Soviet prisoners of war — who were shot by the thousands — as well as others.",
            "As in other camps, Jewish prisoners were singled out at Sachsenhausen for particularly harsh treatment, and most who remained alive by 1942 were sent to the Auschwitz death camp.",
            "Sachsenhausen was liberated in April 1945 by the Soviets, who then turned it into a brutal camp of their own.",
            "Tuesday’s verdict relies on recent legal precedent in Germany establishing that anyone who helped a Nazi camp function can be prosecuted for being an accessory to the murders committed there.",
            "In a different case, a 96-year-old woman went on trial in late September in the northern German town of Itzehoe. The woman, who allegedly worked during the war as the secretary for the SS commandant of the Stutthof concentration camp, has been charged with more than 11,000 counts of accessory to murder."

        "news_article": [
            "There are few more unsettling examples of movies as mirrors to society than some of the great teen films of the ’90s. Those who lived through the decade might recall that while more politicians voiced their support for same-sex marriages, “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” was also in effect and casual homophobia and heteronormativity were as rampant as ever, including throughout high school hallways.",
            "Movies like “Can’t Hardly Wait,” “Cruel Intentions” and “Clueless” captured that period, to a startling degree. They reinforced what had already been in the cultural zeitgeist, including queer teens’ own internalized homophobia.",
            "Reflecting on some of their images today, with over 20 years of hindsight, is a brutal reminder of the roles we were all socialized to play as teens in an oppressively homophobic society.",
            "A plotline from “Cruel Intentions” immediately springs to mind. Prickly playboy Sebastian (Ryan Phillippe) has just been rejected by his latest female conquest Annette (Reese Witherspoon), and his ego is bruised. So, Sebastian turns to his openly gay acquaintance Blaine (Joshua Jackson) to seduce closeted football jock Greg (Eric Mabius), the one who blabbed about Sebastian’s reputation to Annette.",
            "Right on cue as Greg and Blaine are lying in bed together, Sebastian comes in and takes a picture of the pair that he uses to manipulate Greg into walking back what he said about him to Annette. Or else he’ll publicly out Greg using the photo.",
            "Erika Abad, who will serve as an assistant professor of communication at Nevada State College in the fall, remembers this storyline with painful precision.",
            "“I can describe the scene because it was so traumatic,” she told HuffPost. “It’s probably so traumatic because it was the first time I had seen normalized the internalized homophobic shame I had experienced as an adolescent.”",
            "She recalled that Greg also pretends to be drunk, and goes as far to say that Blaine made him have sex, when Sebastian “catches” them. “So the first powerful scene of that movie is, my gay act is an act of violence,” Abad continued. “And [Sebastian] is like, ‘I don’t care what you’re doing. I just need you to do me a favor.’ It was entrapment.”",
            "And with Greg apparently now taken care of, the movie is kicked into high gear and leaves both him and Blaine far in its rearview mirror to be merely remembered as the plot devices for the straight white male character.",
            "While the threat of revenge porn was not as prevalent among teens in the ’90s as it is today, what plotlines like the one in “Cruel Intentions” do is illuminate the era’s persistent need to weaponize queerness or incite enough fear in queer people so that they’re silenced entirely.",
            "The movie bolstered an already understood reality that there was no safe space to be queer at all. Many queer teens like Emily Gallagher and Austin Elston, filmmakers and co-founders of Fishtown Films, didn’t even know a lot of openly queer teens in high school, for that reason.",
            "“I think that speaks specifically to the culture as well,” Elston said. “You didn’t feel comfortable in the ’90s, or at least in my school, to be like, ‘Hey, I’m queer. I’m out. This is who I am.’”",
            "“Cruel Intentions” was also released just one year after 21-year-old Matthew Shepard was killed in a hate crime. Fear among young queer people was already part of their daily lives. “We’re coming out of the Reagan era, Bush one,” Elston recalled. “Even into Clinton to some degree. We have the AIDS epidemic presented as a gay disease and all these [things] signaling to us that there’s a problem with it. Like, if you are this way, you are going to end up dead.”",
            "It meant that there were times when queer teens felt they had to conform to heteronormativity just to fit in. That was true for Elston, who played sports in school, and says he probably even laughed along with his teammates’ homophobic jokes, as well as Abad, who attended Catholic school as a teenager.",
            "“Even though I was questioning [my identity], I would still say homophobic things because homophobic things were a way to demonstrate that you’re subscribing to the social script,” Abad said. “I didn’t beat anybody up. It was just casual homophobia.”",
            "That casual homophobia was often replicated onscreen in films such as “House Party,” which includes Kid’s (Christopher Reid) nearly two-minute song riddled with homophobic messaging that he raps in order to distract his cellmates from trying to rape him when he ends up in jail.",
            "“It’s reinforced in the films,” Elston said. “And you’re like, this is really fucking problematic. On so many levels.”",
            "There’s also not a single Black queer person in “House Party.” “Not at all, because Black people aren’t gay,” Abad said sarcastically.",
            "The erasure, or muting of queerness, definitely has some nuance when we talk about it within the lens of race and how that’s portrayed — or largely ignored, as Abad implied — in ’90s films. And for that matter, female queerness, aside from rare exceptions like “But I’m A Cheerleader,” is barely considered then because it was too often recognized as a function for straight male lust.",
            "Like, when Sebastian’s villainous step-sister Kathryn (Sarah Michelle Gellar) kisses Cecile (Selma Blair) in “Cruel Intentions.” “Watching that kiss, it was like, ‘huh?’” Gallagher said. “What was the motivation for this? This isn’t at all sexy. Like, come on.”",
            "But that’s attributed to the way that sexuality, as well as gender, was so performative in the ’90s, to the point where teens policed gender so that it fit their individual standards and desires.",
            "The homophobic F-word, for example, was often used as a way to indicate a type of masculinity that was not socially acceptable.",
            "Conversely, what we see in a film like “Can’t Hardly Wait” with — you guessed it, another jock — Mike (Peter Facinelli) is an image of masculinity that is not only permissible; it’s aspirational.",
            "So, when that character tries to get back with ex-girlfriend Amanda (Jennifer Love Hewitt) by professing his love for her in the middle of their class’ graduation house party, it’s met with homophobic shame. That’s also followed by simultaneous laughter both among their peers and us teens watching the film in theaters in 1998.",
            "The same thing happens with “Clueless” when Murray (Donald Faison) tells his girlfriend (Stacey Dash) and her friend (Alicia Silverstone) that their new pal (Justin Walker) is gay: “He’s a disco-dancing, Oscar Wilde-reading, Streisand ticket-holding friend of Dorothy.” Side-splitting laughter.",
            "Admittedly, it’s an iconic line. There’s also another thing true here. “What’s really happening with these homophobic epithets is trying to reinforce gender normativity through humor and play,” Abad said.",
            "It’s what turns Mike’s otherwise heartfelt moment in “Can’t Hardly Wait” into an opportunity for playful homophobia. Because the mere expression of emotions is considered an attribute of queerness throughout the ’90s.",
            "“He really makes himself vulnerable in front of the entire party,” said Frankie Mastrangelo, a media scholar and sociology professor at Virginia Commonwealth University.",
            "“Then it’s capped with somebody yelling the F-word at him,” she continued. “Any display of vulnerability, trying to express your emotions, is met with the F-word. Homophobia and masculinity are always doing this work of reinforcing one another and operating in tandem.”",
            "They also collaborate to help put the person in question in their place. Like when a lovelorn and drunk Mike is later photographed nude as if in a queer embrace — as part of a revenge porn plot gone awry — with William (Charlie Korsmo), the nerd he used to bully and with whom he reconciles at the party.",
            "We learn in a list of postscripts that that polaroid is deemed “incriminating” when it resurfaces in his adult life and he loses his job at the car wash. Even with mere seconds left until the end of “Can’t Hardly Wait,” the film manages to underscore a dim future for queerness, strengthening teens’ greatest fears at the time.",
            "It’s only when Gallagher revisited the film recently that these images crystallized in her mind.",
            "“It was saying that in 20 years, this was still going to be problematic,” Gallagher said. “I didn’t realize how much overt homophobia was everywhere in everything. You just move through it like, ‘Okay, this is just what it is.’ You just have to be quiet and you’ll find your people eventually.”",
            "Statements like Gallagher’s is why looking back on these films that defined our formative years, for better and worse, begs us to reckon with our nostalgia as well as the unflinching mirror they held up to ourselves and the problematic world around us.",
            "But that’s also why there are still so many of us who enjoy rewatching these films. Because just as much as they trigger “the vibes, the feels” of our past, as Gallagher believes, they challenge us in ways that it needs to in order to truly evolve as humans.",
            "“I have a lot of affinity for films that aren’t perfect because they allow for thought to be had,” Elston said. “Like, okay, this is where we were as a culture. Even if it’s not intentional, this is what it’s talking about.”",
            "And, ultimately, it’s about how to absorb this new context today. “It engages me in a way that I can actually converse with myself about where I stand now and what I like,” Elston said."

            "The tribute began with a video featuring fellow New York rapper Jay-Z speaking on how Diddy’s refusal to take no for an answer helped break barriers and redefine culture.

            "Diddy closed the performance with a video of the late Kim Porter, his former partner and mother of three of his children, who died in 2019. In the clip, Porter praises Diddy for his hard work and tells him “you’ve arrived.”",

            "“This is my favorite artist. You see I’m saying favorite artist — everything, not specifically production, the trip,” he told the audience. “Back then there was so many rules to hip-hop and he broke all of them. Understood contracts in a way a lot of us still don’t. Understood money in a way a lot of us still don’t. I go to him for advice to this day. He inspired so many of my choices.”",

I had this dream of us unifying, not just talk on the stages, but us — we know our community and our allies.”",

In 2007, Diddy took the helm at Ciroc and turned the vodka brand into a multimillion-dollar brand and party staple. In 2014, he bought premium tequila brand Deleon.",
            "This year, Diddy announced the launch of his new R&B label, Love Records, with Motown Records. The first project from the label will be an album from Diddy himself, which is slated to release this summer."

            "VLISSINGEN-OOST, The Netherlands ― On this windswept peninsula near the Belgian border, the trees grow shrubby and the dune grasses bow horizontally before the North Sea’s gusts. But along the coast, industrial spires rise vertically, defying nature and creating a skyline of steeples to the rival faiths in this country’s energy future.",
            "Ivory-colored wind turbines bristle from flat meadows. Gray smokestacks reach skyward from an oil refinery’s bramble of metal pipes. Steel pylons tower over the salt-sprayed landscape, fringing the two-lane road with a garland of high-voltage power lines.",
            "Yet for half a century, the steadiest emission-free energy here has come from inside what looks like a stubby, dull-looking grain silo.",
            "That’s the Borssele Nuclear Power Station, the only full-scale commercial reactor the Dutch ever built. Opened in 1973, the complex machine for capturing the energy from split uranium atoms was the second reactor built in the country, and it provides about 3% of the Netherlands’ electricity. It’s relatively small compared to other plants of the time, as it was originally planned as the first of six in this area. But that was back in fission electricity’s midcentury glory days, before Chernobyl and Fukushima transformed from far-flung place names into synonyms for catastrophe that compelled many nations to abandon their atomic ambitions and embrace fossil fuels.",
            "The Borssele reactor’s lonely 49 years may soon come to an end.",
            "If the plant were 100 miles east, in Germany, or a mere 10 miles south, in Belgium, that would almost certainly mean that the reactor ― despite currently having regulatory permits to operate for at least 12 more years ― was shutting down early. But unlike its two closest neighbors, which have rapidly decommissioned their own nuclear stations while squeamishly burning more gas and coal, the Netherlands plans to build at least two new reactors in the coming years.",
            "The Dutch government’s proposal, which names this site as one of three potential locations for the nation’s next reactors, represents a rare bet on traditional nuclear power at a time when more countries are closing existing plants than opening new ones.",
            "Nuclear power is by far the most efficient source of electricity. Thanks to stringent regulations around the world, it’s also among the safest. Flight crews on high-altitude airline routes are on average exposed to about five times more radiation than workers at nuclear plants. No country has completed a permanent disposal facility for radioactive waste yet, but several such sites are underway, and, regardless, there is a relatively small amount of spent fuel in the world.",
            "Most deaths involving nuclear energy stem from construction accidents. Even after combining the two infamous disasters in Ukraine and Japan with every worker known to have died mining or milling uranium, the total deaths linked to nuclear power over the past 80 years rank just above wind and solar when compared to the volume of energy produced. By contrast, just the fine air pollution from burning fossil fuel is responsible for 1 in 5 premature deaths worldwide each year, Harvard University scientists found last year. And that’s not counting industrial accidents or the ever-widening toll of climate change.",
            "For decades, visions of mushroom clouds, scenes of Homer Simpson in the nuclear control room and images of radiation-blistered skin have made the improbable seem inevitable. But with planet-heating emissions soaring, once-rare floods, droughts and heatwaves are compounding to make the biblical look literal. And the Dutch, struggling to meet their climate goals, may finally be ready to invest seriously in nuclear energy again.",
            "How Nuclear Power Became Taboo",
            "Fission reactions are complex molecular events: A neutron slams into a larger atom, splitting its nucleus into two smaller nuclei and releasing tremendous amounts of energy in the form of heat and radiation. After first discovering the phenomenon in 1934, physicist Enrico Fermi, having fled fascist Italy with his Jewish wife, carried out the first controlled fission reaction at a University of Chicago laboratory in 1942. Shortly thereafter, the U.S. government ― newly embroiled in World War II ― recruited Fermi to join the Manhattan Project.",
            "On Aug. 6, 1945, the destructive power of fission reactions made its debut to the world when the Enola Gay, a U.S. bomber, dropped a 9,700-pound uranium atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, instantly killing tens of thousands of people and destroying 5 square miles of the city. Four years later, on Aug. 27, 1949, the Soviet Union successfully tested its first atomic bomb.",
            "Just as soon as this apocalyptic arms race had begun, a separate competition would kick off. On Dec. 20, 1951, U.S. government scientists produced electricity using heat from a nuclear fission reactor to run steam turbines at a national laboratory test site in Idaho. Two years later, on Dec. 8, 1953, President Dwight Eisenhower delivered his famous “Atoms for Peace” speech, in which he pitched nuclear power as a tool for abundant peacetime energy production.",
            "On June 27, 1954, the Soviets connected a nuclear reactor about 70 miles southwest of Moscow to a power grid for the first time. On Aug. 26, 1956, the British hooked Calder Hall 1, the first industrial-scale commercial nuclear reactor in the world, up to the grid in Windscale, England.",
            "Eisenhower’s speech was well-received in the Netherlands, which held positive public exhibitions on nuclear power and began work on an experimental reactor laboratory in the late 1950s. The Suez Crisis, brought on by the war between Israel and Egypt, had sent oil prices soaring, increasing demand for an alternative energy source. In the early 1960s, the country started construction on a small, pilot-project reactor about an hour southeast of Utrecht. The Dodewaard nuclear plant was completed in 1968 without ever facing “meaningful societal questioning let alone opposition,” according to an Eindhoven University of Technology report on the history of Dutch nuclear energy. Just as the plant started producing electricity in 1969, workers broke ground on Borssele, a reactor 10 times larger, on the coast in Zeeland, the Netherlands’ westernmost and least populous province.",
            "Nuclear reactors offered bountiful energy and independence from the geopolitics of fossil fuels in a country with recent memories of hunger and military occupation.",
            "But as Cold War stockpiles expanded and weapon tests increased in frequency and payload, opposition grew, and nuclear power became a target. By the time Borssele came online, the political landscape had changed with the launch of several new anti-nuclear groups.",
            "That nascent movement gained steam in March 1979, when one of the valves that controlled the flow of coolant water to a reactor at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, jammed, causing the radioactive core to overheat.",
            "No one died or even became sick as a result of any radiation leak, the Environmental Protection Agency found at the time. But to those already skeptical of nuclear power, the accident cemented the fear that no reactor could ever truly be safe enough. That year, activists rallied in the parking lot in front of Borssele, calling for an end to nuclear power in the Netherlands. Hoping to get a formal read on where the Dutch people stood, the government in the late 1970s organized a public study and debate known as a Broad Societal Discussion on nuclear power.",
            "In 1984, the results of that public study showed a majority of the Dutch did not favor building new nuclear power plants. But the government still pressed ahead with plans to build as many as five new reactors.",
            "Then Chernobyl happened. In April 1986, operator errors and design flaws led to a meltdown at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in Soviet Ukraine. About two dozen workers and firefighters died, and nearly 115,000 people were forced to relocate away from the 1,000-square-mile irradiated exclusion zone. The total death toll from the resulting radiation fallout remains the subject of debate. In 2005, a team of 100 United Nations scientists concluded that about 50 people had died of exposure-related illnesses and projected that thyroid cancer would kill an additional 4,000. In 2016, the World Health Organization traced more than 11,000 thyroid cancer cases to Chernobyl. Yet Greenpeace, a fierce opponent of nuclear energy, has long promoted 93,000 as the likely total death toll, citing Russian academic data and a wider range of illnesses that could potentially be linked to radiation exposure.",
            "Either way, the disaster upended the nuclear debate across the world. In the Netherlands, the public had already begun to turn against nuclear power. In the years since it first built Dodewaard, the country had become a fossil fuel powerhouse, producing the lion’s share of Western Europe’s natural gas from wells in its northernmost province of Groningen. Oil and gas was booming and climate change was not widely understood, so why take the risk with reactors?",
            "Shortly after the accident in Ukraine, the Dutch government halted the process for selecting sites for two new reactors and began a “herbezinning,” or rethinking, of nuclear plans. A uranium enrichment facility owned by the company Urenco Group opened in the eastern Netherlands. But by 1988, the Dutch abandoned plans for more nuclear infrastructure. In 1991, a joint Dutch-German reactor project just over the border in Germany fell apart, and within four years its buildings were sold and turned into an amusement park. In 1997, the Netherlands shut down the Dodewaard plant years ahead of schedule as officials told Reuters “it was clear there was no political support for nuclear power in the Netherlands.” The government slated Borssele for closure in 2003.",
            "The anti-nuclear movement remained strong. In 2001, Dutch police arrested 16 demonstrators staging protests at Borssele and the by-then-defunct Dodewaard facility.",
            "But as the Cold War memories faded and global temperatures began to tick upward, public opinion on nuclear power started shifting again. In 1996, just 14% of Dutch adults considered nuclear energy to be a “little” or “very” good source for large-scale electricity production. That number ticked steadily downward before reaching 10% in 2001, according to University of Amsterdam research. In 2002, however, the figure jumped to 21%, then to 22% in 2003 and 24% in 2005.",
            "After its closure was postponed, Dutch regulators in 2006 granted Borssele a license to operate through 2034. In 2009, the Dutch utility Delta ― which owns 70% of EPZ, the company that operates Borssele ― started the licensing process to build a second reactor next to the existing one. In 2010, a general election propelled center-right Prime Minister Mark Rutte to power. Rutte’s conservative VVD party had long supported the expansion of nuclear power and, upon taking office, the new administration revived plans to build the first new reactors in decades. That November, Delta, signed a memorandum of understanding with French utility giant EDF to begin work on a reactor.",
            "Then disaster struck ― again. In March 2011, an earthquake sent a tsunami crashing on Japan’s northeast coast, killing nearly 19,000 people and disabling the power and cooling systems at the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear plant. A meltdown ensued at the long-troubled plant, which was later revealed to have shirked modern safety standards, and radiation rendered more than 300 square miles temporarily uninhabitable. One worker later died of cancer ― the only death attributed to radiation. And 573 evacuees, mostly elderly residents, died from stress related to the incident, according to a survey by the newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun.",
            "The response, however, was seismic. Japan halted all its reactors. South Korea’s ruling liberal party adopted an unwavering anti-nuclear stance. The U.S. shelved most plans for new nuclear reactors and continued shutting down existing ones. Germany adopted the most extreme position, making the closure of its nuclear fleet a priority over the next decade. In the Netherlands, Rutte called the German response “curious” and said he hoped to continue with plans for more nuclear power.",
            "But Delta struggled to find partners for the project and in 2011 delayed the licensing procedure. In 2012, the municipally owned utility ― which has since changed its name to the Provincial Zeeland Energy Company ― suspended plans for a new reactor indefinitely.",
            "By 2018, however, the planet’s temperatures had risen by about 1 degree Celsius on average, causing billions of dollars in damage from the resulting increase in cataclysmic storms, heat and floods. Far from even flattening out, planet-heating emissions were still growing year over year. That October, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a stark new report outlining what it would mean if the planet warms by 1.5 degrees and what it would take to prevent that from happening. The conclusions were relatively conservative, given that the IPCC is a consensus-based body with hundreds of scientists from almost every country. Yet they were sobering. Humanity needed an unprecedented overhaul of the entire global economy, and it needed to happen with almost unfathomable speed. To do that, the scientists concluded, nuclear power would need to play a part.",
            "When That Taboo Became A Joke",
            "Even before the IPCC report came out, pro-nuclear advocates had set their sights on the Netherlands, hoping the Rutte government’s embrace of atomic energy could yield a breakthrough. In September 2018, Michael Shellenberger, a pro-nuclear activist from California, held a workshop in Amsterdam for advocates hoping to reverse Europe’s nuclear retreat. Known for his pugnacious style and political provocations, the American, who would later go on to make an unsuccessful bid for governor of California, implored his audience to go on the offense and hold more public demonstrations in support of nuclear power.",
            "In late October, pro-nuclear activists gathered to do just that and held a rally in Munich, Germany. Dutch news stations covered the event. That rally, and the TV coverage of it, would prove remarkably effective.",
            "Among the many Dutch viewers who saw the news segment was Arjen Lubach, the host of a weekly satirical news show who is often compared to John Oliver, and with good reason: both men’s shows have a similar pacing and tone. Lubach devoted a 20-minute segment of a November 2018 show to puncturing what he described as the myths and taboos of nuclear energy.",
            "“The IPCC basically says we can’t go without nuclear energy, we must use it. And a lot of environmental groups, for example Greenpeace, are in denial,” Lubach said near the end of his monologue, teeing up a clip of a Dutch Greenpeace spokesperson saying “cleaner solutions” are preferable to nuclear power.",
            "“Yeah, that’s what everyone says,” Lubach said, throwing his arms up in the air. “Everyone feels that way! But we don’t have that luxury.”",
            "The nuclear plant at Borssele, he said, produced as much energy as 600 Eiffel Tower-sized wind turbines during one good year.",
            "“If we are serious about the climate, we really need to think differently and look at nuclear power,” Lubach said. “It may well be that in 40 years we invent something with really good batteries, or that we produce energy from the static fur of our pets, or whatever. But as long as we don’t have those optimistic futuristic techniques, we just need nuclear power.”",
            "Lubach’s broadcasts often reached 600,000 to 1 million viewers. But that segment had been viewed more than 2.6 million times on YouTube alone as of this June. It marked something of a turning point.",
            "Within days of the episode airing, lawmakers from Rutte’s VVD party introduced a proposal to build new nuclear plants. And Dutch newspapers, especially the more conservative-leaning Die Telegraaf, started pumping out a steady stream of stories backing up Lubach’s point that it was time to overcome old fears and embrace nuclear power again.",
            "A Nuclear Renaissance?",
            "The resulting years of debate concluded last December with a coalition government agreement between Rutte’s VVD, the centrist D66 party and two Christian parties. The agreement called for building two new nuclear power plants with 500 million euros, or about $522 million, in government spending to back the projects up by 2025. Total government support for new nuclear, the coalition projected, would top 5 billion euros by the end of the decade.",
            "The agreement listed Borssele as one of three viable sites for the new reactors, along with one in Groningen and another outside Rotterdam.",
            "But in an interview with HuffPost over Zoom, Dutch Energy Minister Rob Jetten said Borssele would be the most likely location. A study by the consultancy KPMG last summer found that provincial officials in Zeeland supported the buildout.",
            "By July 1, Jetten’s office said it would send a letter to the Netherlands’ House of Representatives, the lower house of the country’s parliament, outlining the government’s process for building new reactors. It’s considered the next procedural step before companies can start drafting proposals.",
            "To supporters of nuclear power, the steps marked desperately overdue progress at a time when it’s needed more urgently than ever before. Not only is the Netherlands already on pace to miss its climate goals, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting sanctions and embargoes have sent oil and gas prices soaring across Europe. As their gas bills help fund the Russian war effort, European Union countries are scrambling for alternatives, including striking new deals to import liquefied natural gas from the U.S., Israel and Egypt. New supplies, however, have failed to match demand as Russia slashed gas exports to Europe this month, sending prices soaring and forcing the region’s largest economy, Germany, to prepare for fuel rationing.",
            "Countries with more nuclear reactors have fared better. Romania, which built two large nuclear power complexes in the 1980s, is now looking to complete another two and remake itself as an energy hub for central Europe.",
            "Finland offers a particularly poignant case study in support of nuclear power. The Nordic country, which borders Russia, has long embraced atomic energy. Even groups like the local Greenpeace chapter and the country’s Green Party, traditionally beachheads for the anti-nuclear movement, support the Finnish industry. Thanks in part to that widespread support, the Finnish in March switched on the long-delayed Olkiluoto-3, one of the world’s largest reactors and the first new one in western Europe in at least 15 years. Two months later, Russia cut off electricity exports to Finland in retaliation for the country’s plan to ditch its decades-long neutrality and join in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The move barely affected Finland, which could now generate nearly 40% of its national power needs from the three reactors on a tiny fleck of land off its southwest coast.",
            "Finland is dark for much of the year, limiting how much solar power the country can generate. The Finns are building more wind energy. But wind power alone cannot reliably power an industrial society of its size, at least under current conditions. Milder than expected winds last summer increased European demand for gas just as prices for the fuel were already spiking, making it harder for countries to refill stockpiles for the winter. And recent research in the journal Nature Geosciences suggests wind patterns could shift significantly as the planet warms, making that resource even less reliable in the years to come.",
            "Today, wind turbines are ubiquitous in the Netherlands, towering even over densely populated areas near Amsterdam. In March, the Dutch government announced plans to double its offshore wind capacity.",
            "But the country has pitched itself as Europe’s future hub for green hydrogen, a zero-carbon fuel that, like fossil fuels, can burn at high temperatures. Hydrogen is already widely used in fertilizers and industrial processes, but virtually all of the fuel on the market today is produced with natural gas or coal. To qualify as “green” in the hydrogen industry’s color-coding system, the fuel must be made with machines called electrolysers that are powered by wind or solar electricity.",
            "The Netherlands has so far vowed to spend more on subsidies for green hydrogen and build more electrolyser plants than any other European Union country. But it’s a controversial energy solution, because roughly 30% of that renewable electricity is lost in the conversion process for making hydrogen. So for those plans to pan out, the Dutch will need to divert huge volumes of renewable power to hydrogen production.",
            "How, then, is the Netherlands supposed to produce enough zero-carbon power to replace its remaining coal- and gas-fired power plants while also providing for the new demand from electric vehicles and home appliances – all while manufacturing green hydrogen in quantities large enough to be competitive?",
            "Majorities of Dutch people would likely say the answer is nuclear power.",
            "A 2018 poll from the news broadcaster EenVandaag found 54% of Dutch adults in favor of nuclear power and 35% against. When the question was reframed to say that the Netherlands could achieve its 2050 climate goals with nuclear power, 63% expressed support with only 27% against.",
            "In 2019, 51% of Dutch adults supported new investments in nuclear energy, with just 14% opposed, in a survey from the pollster Ipsos. More than half of Dutch people 35 and younger responded that they “completely agree” with building new nuclear power stations, with less than one-third of respondents against it in a 2021 poll from the newspaper Trouw and the election-information website Kieskompas.",
            "The one polling outlier appears to be a 2020 survey from the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics, which asked respondents to give their opinions on energy sources after explaining: “Energy is sustainable when it’s produced by sources that don’t hurt the climate and will never run out, such as solar and wind.” Nuclear advocates argue there is little to no risk of running short on uranium fuel, given that reactors use so little and vast quantities could still be mined or extracted from seawater. And while sunlight and wind are indeed virtually infinite resources, the metals and alloys needed to make the photovoltaic panels and turbines that harness them are not.",
            "Yet that framing appeared to weigh on how the issue was perceived. In response to the prompt, 25% of those surveyed said they favored more nuclear power, 12% said the current amount was appropriate, about 18% said they preferred less nuclear power and a little over 25% wanted none of it at all.",
            "New Plans, Old Problems",
            "A comedian may have helped shift Dutch public opinion on nuclear power. But asked where things go from here, Gerard Brinkman, one of the Dutch anti-nuclear movement’s most prominent figures, chortled.",
            "“This is not the first time for any of this,” he said over Zoom last month. “We had the same proposal in 1985, then the accident in Chernobyl halted those plans. There were the same plans also in 2010. Then came Fukushima. So, as a sick joke, I almost think that every time the right-wing parties in the Netherlands are proposing to build new nuclear power plants, there will be some new accident around the world. Hopefully not, of course.”",
            "This might be gallows humor were Brinkman not so convinced that the government’s plans for new reactors would never make it past the paperwork phase.",
            "Advocates of nuclear power point to the United Arab Emirates’ Barakah Nuclear Power Plant as a sign that an industry revival is possible. Despite starting construction in 2011 just after the Fukushima accident, the $24 billion station in the Abu Dhabi desert completed construction on its third reactor last November. The full trio, built by South Korea’s Korea Electric Power Corp. with enough capacity to supply 25% of the energy-thirsty UAE’s needs, is scheduled to start producing power next year.",
            "But the UAE is an authoritarian country with almost unrivaled oil riches. Democratic countries with cultures and political systems more akin to the Netherlands have faced steeper challenges.",
            "In the U.S., two South Carolina utilities abruptly canceled construction on two new nuclear plants in 2017 after spending $9 billion and billing ratepayers for the cost. Now the only new reactors underway in the country are two units at the Alvin W. Vogtle Electric Generating Plant in eastern Georgia. The project broke ground in 2012 at a price tag of about $14 billion and promised to be producing electricity by 2017. After a series of delays, the reactors have now cost more than $30 billion and won’t be completed until next year at the earliest. Meanwhile, states like New York and Michigan have closed nuclear plants deemed safe to operate, replacing the reactors with fossil fuels.",
            "In the United Kingdom, Hinkley Point C, a two-unit nuclear plant the French utility giant EDF is building in southwest England, is facing similar delays and cost overruns, with the price tag now topping $31 billion.",
            "Those problems have even crossed the English Channel into France, which famously generates most of its electricity from fission after building 56 nuclear reactors in just 15 years, starting in the mid-1970s. In January, EDF announced delays and new expenses on its Flamanville 3 reactor. Now a mysterious corrosion issue is plaguing nearly half of the country’s reactors, with a dozen closed and awaiting inspections as of this month.",
            "Finland finished its Olkiluoto-3, but the project took 12 years to complete. And the country pulled the plug on its next nuclear reactor, a joint venture with the Russian state-owned nuclear firm Rosatom, after the Ukraine war broke out.",
            "In an interview in a plain conference room at Borssele, Carlo Wolters, the chief executive of the plant operator EPZ, said his company would propose building the next Dutch reactors right here. But he said he would reject any bids from Russian or Chinese companies, which he said posed too much geopolitical risk.",
            "“If you build a nuclear plant, you have to look 60 years ahead, so it’s wise to choose partners you can build a stable relationship with,” Wolters said.",
            "Doing so, however, shrinks a pool of potential investors that critics of nuclear power say is already too shallow to yield results.",
            "“The reality is, I don’t think anything will be built,” said Jan Haverkamp, a senior expert on nuclear energy and energy policy at Greenpeace. “Although the conservatives are claiming that there are interested parties in the market, there are no really interested parties.”",
            "Borssele is profitable, EPZ said. The KPMG study found that companies interested in bidding on nuclear projects or buying power from new reactors see a stable government policy on nuclear energy as a necessary precondition to building new facilities. And the country’s prime minister for the last 12 years has remained steadfast in his support of nuclear power.",
            "But the Netherlands is bound by an international agreement known as the Aarhus Convention, which gives countries within a certain radius of any large industrial projects, including nuclear reactors, the right to voice opposition. Germany and Belgium, both of which are on track to close their own nuclear reactors within the next few years, would almost certainly challenge the Dutch plans.",
            "And even within the Netherlands, Dutch law gives opponents of nuclear power ample opportunities to push back against the plans.",
            "“Haverkamp is an expert at lining up rules and regulations and knowing when to interrupt something and when to stay quiet, so definitely these guys will make it as difficult as possible,” said Joris van Dorp, a pro-nuclear activist who helped organize the 2018 rally in Munich.",
            "He said he and other supporters of nuclear power were urging the Rutte administration to prepare for those challenges in part by changing Dutch laws to give reactors the same fast-track process that benefits wind and solar projects. But even that may prove ineffective against a determined opposition.",
            "“It only takes one guy or girl to chain themselves to a fence and lock down a whole building site for weeks. You can do a lot of damage,” van Dorp said. “You can really get people riled up and get people to accept that there are all sorts of ways you can stop these projects from proceeding within the confines of the law. Then it’s going to be hard.”",
            "Traditionally, conservative parties across the democratic world have favored nuclear power while those on the political left opposed it. The realities of climate change have begun to shift that ideological mapping in many nations, particularly among younger voters. But in the Netherlands, that dynamic still holds, with conservative and right-leaning parties largely backing nuclear power and those on the center-left and left against. The upstart progressive party Volt is an outlier in its support for nuclear reactors, though it only holds three seats in the parliament. A dogged opponent of atomic energy, GroenLinks, the green party, has 16 seats. D66, the second-largest party after Rutte’s VVD and a member of the governing coalition, remains split on nuclear power.",
            "Still, Silvio Erkens, a Dutch member of parliament from the VVD party, said at least two-thirds of the legislature supports the prime minister’s plan for new reactors.",
            "“Am I certain they will be built? As certain as you can be in parliament,” he said. “We reserved money for it, got a majority in parliament and agreed that in the coming three years it will make the decision irreversible. It will not be built in three years. But it should be irreversible.”",
            "Yet already some supporters of nuclear power have expressed concern that Jetten, the energy minister, is slow-walking the government’s letter to parliament on new nuclear reactors, which was originally due to come out this month. A member of the D66 party, Jetten previously opposed new reactors.",
            "“I was born and raised in a village where everyone is anti-nuclear because of the U.S. Air Force presence over there. Everyone has an emotional history, a family history, and I’ve even got people in my own political party who joined anti-nuclear protests 30 years ago,” Jetten told me over Zoom. “But I’m now advocating for nuclear power because of the independence Europe should get from Russian imports.… Countries that have invested more in nuclear power plants are in a better position these days.”",
            "Still, he said, “I’m 35, and I don’t want to be a climate minister who was responsible for a huge nuclear waste problem that new generations have to deal with. So, there are pros and cons.”",
            "Haverkamp said the government’s money would be better spent on energy efficiency measures or building dense, low-carbon apartment buildings in a country struggling with a housing shortage and a dependence on gas heating systems. Even if the reactors were built, he said, “it will take years.”",
            "“They will not be connected to grids until 2034 or 2035, which means we’re spending 5 billion euros at least, maybe more, for climate solutions that will not be a climate solution for the next 13 to 14 years,” Haverkamp said.",
            "Some nuclear boosters have suggested the Netherlands should consider small modular reactors, essentially reworked versions of the technology that powers nuclear submarines. While estimates vary, industry analysts generally project the technology will become commercially viable within the next five years, and proponents say the smaller machines, with parts that can be manufactured in a factory, will be much cheaper and easier to deploy.",
            "“Building nuclear power plants takes a lot of time and a lot of money. These are political risks, but I am confident the current political coalition is determined to get the ball rolling,” Henri Bontenbal, an energy consultant and Dutch member of parliament from the center-right Christian Democratic Appeal party, told me in an email. “Therefore I believe that small nuclear reactors can be a worthwhile addition to the nuclear mix, as those plants could operate before 2030.”",
            "But supporters of nuclear power say building new reactors does, in fact, represent a long-term strategy and one that should not interfere with near-term plans to deploy more renewables, install more electric vehicle infrastructure and make buildings more efficient. A large part of why nuclear plants have become so expensive and slow, they argue, is simply that few countries have been building them. As such, the workforce of designers, project managers and construction crews with experience building reactors has shrunk over the past four decades. The completion of projects in the UAE, U.S. and Finland could make more of those skills available to the Netherlands.",
            "“Restarting European nuclear construction is as painful as it is necessary,” said Mark Nelson, a Chicago-based nuclear engineer and consultant who advocates for atomic power. “Who better to get it off to a good start again than the Dutch, who have always had to engineer to survive?”",
            "Even if it’s difficult and costly, research from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology shows that the best way to truly decarbonize a power grid and avoid blackouts while doing so is to pair renewables with what are called “firm” sources of zero-carbon generation, such as nuclear reactors, hydroelectric dams or geothermal power. The low-lying Netherlands is too flat for dams, and, while geothermal energy has significant potential, the country does not have the vast volcanic heat resources of nearby Iceland.",
            "“Renewables are very good, but the economy as we know it today, where we gained a lot of wealth, longevity and healthier, longer life through use of fossil energy, you can’t replace that with just renewables,” said Floriske Deutman, a consultant and member of D66 who has tried to push the party to embrace nuclear power. “Most people don’t realize that.”",
            "She compared opposing nuclear energy as a tool to deal with climate change to opposing COVID-19 vaccines.",
            "“The hardcore anti-nuclear people are similar to the anti-vaccine movement, because it’s based on misleading information to solve a problem,” Deutman said. “Unless solving the climate crisis and mitigating global warming is not your primary concern.”",
            "One May afternoon, the sun broke through the clouds over Borssele, illuminating the construction cranes dismantling what remained of the coal plant EPZ once ran next to the nuclear station. The nearby refinery was largely quiet. The steam turbine in the nuclear plant hummed steadily. During a tour of the facility to see the reactor up close, a worker told me you could see the hyperboloid cooling towers of Belgium’s Doel Nuclear Power Station from atop the dike that protected this part of Zeeland from the North Sea. The plant, located on the outskirts of the Belgian industrial metropolis Antwerp, was one of the country’s last two nuclear stations. The plan had been to shut both facilities down in the next three years, though the government in Brussels is reconsidering as energy prices spike.",
            "I climbed the grassy barrier, which had been elevated after the devastating 1953 floods that killed more than 1,800 people. For centuries, the Dutch had summoned their country from watery depths, draining swamps, digging canals and redirecting rivers to claim land for their people. But after that catastrophe, the Netherlands renewed its commitment to engineering its long-term survival in a place that could be easily reclaimed by the sea. Up went higher sea barriers.",
            "From atop the dike, Antwerp was invisible, shrouded behind a veil of smog and haze. As I squinted, I wondered, could the view possibly be clearer from the other side?"

            "TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned Saturday that the U.S. Supreme Court decision to overturn a constitutional right to abortion could lead to the loss of other rights and indicated his country would continue to allow Americans to get abortions in Canada.",
            "Trudeau called the court’s decision “horrific” and voiced concern that the ruling could someday allow a rollback of legal protections for gay relationships, including the right for same-sex couples to marry.",
            "“We know that this is an extremely, not just scary, but disheartening time for so many women,” Trudeau said at a news conference in Kigali, Rwanda, at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.",
            "“Women for generations have fought for more rights in the United States, (only) to see this setback, to worry as well about how this can be expanded to more rights be taken away in the United States,” he said.",
            "“This is a reminder of how we need to be unequivocal in our defense of people’s rights, in not taking anything for granted, in staying vigilant, and always standing up for woman’s rights, for LBGT rights, for the rights of people who are disenfranchised and marginalized,” he added.",
            "Asked if his government would help American women seeking abortions in Canada, Trudeau did not directly respond, but said: “Everyday Americans who find themselves in Canada access our health care system in Canada and that’s certainly something that will continue,”",
            "However the cost, the need to travel and to have a passport make that prohibitive for some Americans.",
            "The ruling is likely to lead to abortion bans in roughly half of American states.",
            "Thirteen states, mainly in the South and Midwest, already had laws to ban abortion in the event Roe was overturned. Another half-dozen states have near-total bans or prohibitions after six weeks, before many women know they are pregnant.",
            "Trudeau vowed to continue to stand up for woman’s rights in the U.S. and elsewhere.",
            "“We have a commitment in Canada to ensure, first of all, that every women has full, safe legal access to the full suite of sexual health and reproductive services, including safe and legal abortions and we’ve been working hard to increase access to women across the country,” Trudeau said."

            "A person renting a cabin in Sevierville, Tennessee, left their parked car around 10 a.m. on Wednesday and came back that evening to find the bear dead inside the vehicle, according to a statement from the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency.",
            "“It appears that the bear got inside the car by using its teeth or paws to open the unlocked door and was trapped inside after the door shut behind it,” the statement said.",

            "He became “impatient,” as several witnesses said, and hit the gas, maneuvering around several cars to ram protesters.",

            "“I had a fight-or-flight response,” Russell told HuffPost. “He had his window down. I grabbed the back of the window to keep up with his car and tried to grab the steering wheel. At some point he grabbed my sign and ripped it, and I fell, and he proceeded to run over one of the girls.”",

            "The Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood on Friday, dismantling the decades-old precedent that protected abortion rights and giving states the go-ahead to dramatically limit access to reproductive health care.",
            "The ruling in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case, written by Justice Samuel Alito, was not a surprise. A draft ruling was leaked to Politico and published in early May; the final ruling hews closely to the leaked draft.",
            "“We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled,” Alito wrote for the majority. “The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision, including the one on which the defenders of Roe and Casey now chiefly rely—the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.”",
            "“That provision has been held to guarantee some rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution, but any such right must be “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition” and “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,” Alito continued.",
            "Abortion is not “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition,” according to Alito, and, therefore, not protected as a right.",
            "Alito was joined in his decision by Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote a separate concurrence, while the liberal minority of Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor filed a joint dissent.",
            "The hard-line conservative ruling will now go nationwide, allowing states to implement strict abortion restrictions that will force some people to continue unwanted and unsafe pregnancies. Victims of rape and incest will, in some states, have to go through the traumas of pregnancy, birth and parenthood or adoption. Babies will be born with health conditions they suffer from and even quickly die from. People who aren’t prepared or don’t want to have children will have to have them anyway.",
            "The ruling does not end abortion rights entirely. Some states have vowed to protect abortion access and will likely become a safe haven for those seeking the procedure who are able to afford to travel. It’s unclear how quickly the 22 states that already have laws limiting abortion will put their bans into effect, but some, including Missouri and Texas, acted quickly to enact their trigger bans in the wake of the ruling. And most state bans restrict abortion only after a certain point in a pregnancy, often with exceptions.",
            "However, that’s not always the case. In Oklahoma, the GOP-controlled legislature passed a bill that would prohibit all abortions, except if the life of the pregnant person was in danger or if a rape had been reported to law enforcement. In other states, Republicans are increasingly pushing abortion restrictions that offer no exceptions for victims of rape or incest.",
            "And some efforts to enshrine abortion rights have failed. Senate Republicans blocked a bill to codify Roe v. Wade in May. The GOP holds an electoral advantage in many states due to district lines and electoral laws.",
            "The case came before the court as conservatives sensed momentum when former President Donald Trump, who promised to only appoint conservatives who would overturn Roe v. Wade, appointed three Supreme Court justices. One of those seats was filled by Trump only after Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) refused to allow then-President Barack Obama to appoint a justice to the seat left vacant by Justice Antonin Scalia’s death in 2016. The die was then cast after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death weeks before the 2020 election allowed Trump to appoint Barrett to give the conservatives a supermajority on the court.",
            "For this reason, Alito’s majority did not need the vote of Roberts, who did not join the other conservative justices and filed a separate concurrence. In his concurrence, Roberts declared that Alito’s opinion was wholly unnecessary to decide the case brought by Mississippi.",
            "“Surely we should adhere closely to principles of judicial restraint, where the broader path the Court chooses entails repudiating a constitutional right we have not only previously recognized, but also expressly reaffirmed applying the doctrine of stare decisis” Roberts wrote. “The Court’s opinion is thoughtful and thorough, but those virtues cannot compensate for the fact that its dramatic and consequential ruling is unnecessary to decide the case before us.”",
            "The liberal justices’ joint dissent notes their “sorrow” at the ruling and the pain and hardship it will bring to those now forced to bear children in the states where abortion is now illegal.",
            "“With sorrow—for this Court, but more, for the many millions of American women who have today lost a fundamental constitutional protection—we dissent,” they wrote.",
            "The liberals also noted that the judicial conservatives are not done stripping Americans of their hard-won rights.",
            "“[The court’s decision] eliminates a 50-year-old constitutional right that safeguards women’s freedom and equal station,” the liberal justices wrote. “It breaches a core rule-of-law principle, designed to promote constancy in the law. In doing all of that, it places in jeopardy other rights, from contraception to same-sex intimacy and marriage. And finally, it undermines the Court’s legitimacy.”",
            "Indeed, Justice Thomas declared in a separate concurrence that the majority opinion excising abortion from protection under the 14th Amendment’s due process clause should be applied to the decisions that legalized contraception, same-sex marriage and same-sex sex.",
            "“[I]n future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell,” Thomas wrote.",
            "The deck is stacked against supporters of abortion rights. However, many advocacy groups were already planning next steps ahead of the ruling.",
            "Some are mobilizing to support people seeking abortions by funding travel to and care in states where the procedure remains legal. The governors of California, Oregon and Washington state announced a pact on Friday to allow patients from around the country to access abortion care in their states.",
            "Another option to protect access is medication abortion, which allows some people seeking to end their pregnancies to do so at home. State-level abortion bans have also targeted medication abortion, but advocates say it’s likely more people will obtain the medication and manage their own abortions should bans go into effect.",
            "On the legislative front, advocates have called for the Senate to end the filibuster, a rule that requires 60 votes for most legislation — allowing the minority party to block bills, even if most senators support them. For now, ending the filibuster is unlikely: Two Senate Democrats, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, oppose ending it. Even if they changed their minds, Democrats likely only have 49 votes in favor of codifying Roe. In the most recent vote, Manchin sided with Republicans to block the bill.",
            "On Friday, Manchin lamented that he had “trusted” Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, both of whom he voted to confirm, when they suggested they would not overturn Roe v. Wade. He added that he supports “legislation that would codify the rights Roe v. Wade previously protected” and hopes the two parties will work together on such a bill.",
            "But most Republicans ― save similarly disappointed lawmakers like Sen. Susan Collins of Maine ― are not interested in codifying abortion rights. On Friday, Republicans cheered the decision and indicated their next aim is to ban abortion across the country.",
            "President Joe Biden vowed on Friday to fight to protect abortion access, including by directing officials to ensure broader access to abortion pills and to protect people’s ability to travel to seek an abortion.",
            "But he said that actually codifying abortion rights into law would take Congress ― meaning voters need to expand Democratic majorities.",
            "“This decision must not be the final word,” Biden said. “This fall, Roe is on the ballot. Personal freedoms are on the ballot. The right to privacy, liberty, equality ― they’re all on the ballot.” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said on CNN Friday that Biden “needs to pick up every tool available to him and use it to protect access to abortion.”She encouraged supporters of abortion rights to keep fighting.“We are not without actions that we can take,” Warren said. “We need to have hope, but we need to hang on to this anger because we can use that anger to fuel change.”",

            "Dr. Deborax Birx, the White House COVID-19 coordinator under President Donald Trump, told House lawmakers she was asked to withhold or change information on weekly pandemic data reports sent to state and local health officials, including guidance on masks.",
            "Birx, appearing Thursday before the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis to discuss the Trump administration’s pandemic response for the first time since she left in January 2021, detailed creative ways she improvised to share the information.",
            "“So I learned to put the things that there were issues with into the second part of a sentence,” Birx said, explaining that she hoped Trump officials skimming her reports wouldn’t spot them.",
            "Birx did not name those officials.",
            "Throughout her testimony, Birx described a breakdown in communication and disarray in the White House COVID response.",
            "She said the belief that COVID would act like the flu in 2020 gave Americans “a false sense of security.” In addition to Trump, Birx said other administration officials “underplayed the seriousness of the pandemic.”",
            "“It wasn’t just the president, many of our leaders, were using words like ‘we could contain,’ and you cannot contain a virus that cannot be seen,” Birx said. “And it wasn’t being seen because we weren’t testing.”",
            "Birx also discussed theories promoted by Dr. Scott Atlas, a COVID adviser to Trump who supported herd immunity as a strategy to fight the pandemic.",
            "The committee obtained emails from Birx, including one in August 2020 in which she wrote to colleagues, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, about Altas’ claims that masks were “overrated,” that testing should be limited, and that testing could hurt the president politically.",
            "“Case identification is bad for the president’s re-election — testing should only be of the sick,” Birx recalled Atlas saying, according to The New York Times.",
            "Birx told the committee on Thursday that Atlas’ presence “certainly destroyed any cohesion in the response in the White House.”",
            "Birx also explained how the theories shared by Altas affected the pandemic response.",
            "“When you no longer agree on what is actually happening in the country and what needs to be done, and there’s not consensus on that, then you lose the ability to execute in the maximum efficient and effective way,” Birx continued.",
            "Asked if more lives would have been saved if the president had followed her recommendations instead of those coming from Atlas, Birx replied “absolutely.”",
            "In an interview with ABC News in April, Birx discussed the infamous press conference where Trump suggested people should inject disinfectant as a way to treat COVID.",
            "“I was paralyzed in that moment because it was so unexpected,” she said.",
            "“I just wanted it to be ‘The Twilight Zone’ and it all go away,” Birx continued. “I could just see everything unraveling in that moment.”",
            "Birx’s testimony comes as scientists continue learning more about the effects of COVID.",
            "Data collected from June 1 to June 13 by the U.S. Census Bureau and analyzed by the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics showed that over 40% of U.S. adults said they had contracted COVID at some point during the pandemic. Of those, one in five continue suffering from “long COVID.”",
            "Researchers from Imperial College London said Thursday nearly 20 million lives were saved by COVID vaccines in the first year they became available.",
            "This shows “just how much worse the pandemic could have been if we did not have these vaccines,” said Oliver Watson, who led the study, according to The Associated Press."

            "Donald Trump’s onetime White House strategist Steve Bannon has sleepwalked into a twisted mess of “woke” and “awakened” analogies that has critics howling with laughter.",
            "Earlier this week, Bannon touted the extremist “army of the awakened” that is supporting the former president and his right-wing ilk.",
            "That startling praise followed years of Bannon pummeling the “woke” — meaning, in extremist speak, those who are sensitive to other people’s needs and rights. As anyone who follows the English language is aware, “awakened” means the same thing as “woke.”",
            "This “army,” according to Bannon, is going to sweep through elections, he first noted earlier this month.",
            "“Our present activities are that we are building an army of the awakened, and we are taking over precinct strategies, we are taking over election boards, canvassing boards, with volunteers called American citizens,” he said on his “War Room” podcast.",
            "Bannon may have tripped into the word tangle thanks to QAnon.",
            "QAnon’s “Great Awakening” was supposed to occur on Jan. 20, 2021, when Joe Biden was sworn in as president. QAnon backers were convinced instead that on that “Great Awakening” day, Trump would expose their imagined Satan-worshipping crew of Democratic pedophile cannibals, declare martial law and remain in power.",
            "Bannon evoked the “army of the awakened” when insisting Wednesday that his podcast will have a “starring role” in an upcoming hearing of the Jan. 6 House select committee that is expected to explore the violent actions of the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers and their supporters, their weapons caches and attacks on police officers during the assault on the U.S. Capitol.",
            "“J6 [the committee] is about shutting down the army of the awakened,” he insisted. It’s “shutting down Trump, but it’s also coming after you,” Bannon warned.",
            "Bannon is battling two contempt of Congress criminal charges since he refused to comply with a subpoena to testify in the Jan. 6 panel’s investigation."

            "If Clarence Thomas gets his way, abortion rights are only the beginning of what should fall.",
            "The conservative Supreme Court justice wrote a concurring opinion Friday in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization ruling, which overturns Americans’ constitutional right to an abortion.",
            "Thomas said justices should also reconsider other cases that rest on the right to privacy — specifically cases protecting contraception access and same-sex relationships.",
            "“In future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell,” Thomas wrote.",
            "These cases have long been in the crosshairs for conservatives, who mock the idea that there’s a constitutional right to privacy. Yet in his opinion for the majority Friday, Justice Samuel Alito said the Dobbs outcome absolutely does not mean that conservatives want to go after those decisions. He even mocked the liberal justices’ dissent for drawing comparisons between “the abortion right and the rights recognized in Griswold (contraception), Eisenstadt (same), Lawrence (sexual conduct with member of the same sex), and Obergefell (same-sex marriage).”",
            "“Perhaps this is designed to stoke unfounded fear that our decision will imperil those other rights,” he added.",
            "But as Thomas’ concurrence makes clear, that fear is very grounded in reality.",
            "Jim Obergefell, the lead plaintiff in the same-sex marriage case and currently a candidate for the Ohio statehouse, sharply criticized Thomas and his comments about marriage equality.",
            "“Clarence Thomas is a Supreme Court justice appointed by humans, he is not the Supreme Deity,” he said in a statement. “The millions of loving couples who have the right to marriage equality to form their own families do not need Clarence Thomas imposing his individual twisted morality upon them. If you want to see an error in judgment, Clarence Thomas, look in the mirror.”",
            "Already, a number of Republican politicians are going down the same path as Thomas, saying they’d like to see cases like Griswold and Obergefell overturned, and considering legislation that could lead to contraception bans or restrictions.",

            "Republicans made clear following the Supreme Court’s decision striking down abortion rights that they won’t stop there: They want to ban abortion nationwide.",
            "“Having been given this second chance for Life, we must not rest and must not relent until the sanctity of life is restored to the center of American law in every state in the land,” Vice President Mike Pence said in a statement praising the court’s decision on Friday.",
            "The ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization does not ban abortion nationally, though it does trigger laws banning or severely restricting abortions in more than 20 Republican-leaning states. A number of blue states, including Massachusetts, California and Illinois, have passed legislation protecting abortion rights.",
            "Republicans and anti-choice activists, however, are making it clear they plan on forcing even those states to ban abortion, either through state-by-state campaigns or a federal law banning the procedure.",
            "“The pro-life movement’s work has just begun,” Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said in a statement praising the ruling. “This issue will now be debated in the 50 states, and a 330,000,000-person, continental nation will work through this debate in a way that’s healthier than Roe’s one-size-fits-all, Washington-centrism.”",
            "Passing a national abortion ban would be politically difficult, but not impossible. Republicans would need to win control of the presidency, the House and large enough majorities in the Senate to either eliminate the filibuster or bypass its 60-vote requirement. (The last requirement is made easier by the Senate’s strong bias towards rural voters, who make up a key part of the GOP base.)",
            "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), for one, allowed that a national abortion ban was “possible” after the initial leak of the Supreme Court’s draft decision. Last week, Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) he would back a federal ban because “any of us that believe this is wrong, it’s wrong, period.”",
            "Some Republican senators and anti-choice activists have begun drafting legislation for a six-week abortion ban.",
            "Such a ban would be unpopular: Just 37% of Americans believe abortion should be illegal most or all of the time, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey.",
            "House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told CNN Friday that he would back codifying a ban on abortions after 15 weeks, which is likely not as far as other members of his party would like to go.",
            "Democratic leaders are playing up the threat of a ban.",
            "“Republicans are plotting a nationwide abortion ban,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Friday morning. “They cannot be allowed to have a majority in the Congress to do that.”",

            "“We don’t have guns in the U.K., that is true, but we don’t have mass shootings either,” a woman, whose identity was unclear, asked Greene at a press conference, according to a clip the congresswoman posted to Twitter. “Children aren’t scared to go to school.”",
            "Greene, flanked by other pro-gun House Republicans, including Reps. Lauren Boebert (Colo.) Thomas Massie (Ky.) and Andrew Clyde (Ga.), replied: “You have mass stabbings, lady. You have all kinds of murder and you’ve got laws against that.”",
            "“Nothing like the same rates here,” the reporter replied.",
            "“Well, you can go back to your country and worry about your no guns. We like ours here,” Greene said.",
            "The U.S. homicide rate is four times higher than the U.K. According to the Pew Research Center, nearly 80% of U.S. murders in 2020 involved a firearm.",
            "Globally, firearms accounted for 54% of all homicides in 2017 while knives accounted for 22%, per a United Nations Global Study on Homicide.",
            "The gun death rate in the U.S. is substantially higher than any other developed nation, most of which have stricter gun control laws. In the past few years, England, Scotland and Wales combined have seen around 30 gun deaths a year. Comparatively, the number of murders involving firearms in the U.S. in 2020 was 19,384.",
            "Greene and many of her House GOP colleagues have criticized a bipartisan gun bill which on Tuesday cleared an initial hurdle to passing in the Senate, breaking a decades-long stalemate on gun control legislation. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act would expand background checks and direct millions of dollars toward helping states enact red-flag laws, which allow authorities to temporarily confiscate firearms from individuals deemed dangerous to themselves or others.",
            "A group of 14 Republicans, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and Sens. John Cornyn (Texas), Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and Mitt Romney (Utah), voted to proceed with the bill.",
            "Greene listed the names of these senators during her press conference, declaring them the elected Republicans that “Republican voters do not support anymore.”",
            "“We’ve gotta change our Republican Party,” she said.",
            "However, polling has repeatedly shown that a majority of voters, including Republicans and gun owners, support background checks and red flag laws."

            "Former Trump White House strategist Steve Bannon is attacking Rupert Murdoch and his media empire for tossing aside Donald Trump in favor of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.",
            "“Fox News, Wall Street Journal, New York Post, Times of London, The Sun etc etc etc ― all lockstep against Trump,” Bannon wrote Wednesday on the right-wing Gettr social media platform. He also attacked the Murdoch family as “Australians via England — not American” who have “never sacrificed anything for this Country.” Murdoch became a U.S. citizen in 1984.",
            "Murdoch has “zero feel” for “America or Americans,” Bannon added.",
            "Bannon was responding to an article in Vanity Fair on Wednesday declaring that “DeSantis fever is spreading across Murdoch’s media empire.”",
            "Murdoch-controlled media outlets have recently launched sharp attacks on Trump, including surprisingly scathing editorials earlier this month in the New York Post and Wall Street Journal.",
            "“Trump betrayed his supporters by conning them on Jan. 6, and he is still doing it,” the Journal editorial stated June 10.",
            "“The King Lear of Mar-a-Lago” who cannot accept defeat has “become a prisoner of his own ego,” the Post said the same day. “He won’t stop insisting that 2020 was ‘stolen’ even though he’s offered no proof that it’s true.”Longtime Murdoch employee Piers Morgan wrote in an opinion piece Monday in the Post that “by almost any political metric you choose, this guy’s [DeSantis] a far better option for leading the Republicans into the 2024 election than Donald Trump.”The British television personality called Trump an “aging, raging gorilla who’s become a whiny, democracy-defying bore.” The headline flatly declared: “It’s Time to Dump The Donald.”Vanity Fair noted Morgan in essence “held up a grenade, pulled out a pin, and lobbed it in the direction of Mar-a-Lago.” More important, the opinion article underscored the message of Murdoch’s media: “Dump Trump,” the magazine added.Morgan predicted that the “mutual admiration society” of DeSantis and Trump was “about to fall apart big-time.”Morgan added: “if there’s one thing Trump can’t stomach more than people who don’t buy into his ‘rigged election’ bulls–t, it’s people who might threaten his chances of returning to the White House in 2024.”The chill is already obvious. DeSantis has opted not to ask Trump for an endorsement for his gubernatorial reelection bid.Trump posted a Zogby poll (which rated a B- rating for predictability last year) on Truth Social on Wednesday that showed him leading with 54% of the expected vote to DeSantis’ 12% in an imagined presidential primary race involving several candidates. Fox News reported Wednesday that a New Hampshire poll showed DeSantis with a razor-thin lead over Trump in that state.",
            "Though Fox News skipped airing the first of the televised hearings by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, the network has aired the rest to date.",
            "Following the hearing Tuesday, Fox anchor Martha MacCallum called out the “stunning” absence of proof to support Trump’s claims that the 2020 election had been rigged against him.",
            "One source told Vanity Fair: “Rupert Murdoch is a pragmatic guy. He knows better than anybody how to read political tea leaves.”"

            "But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52.",
            "Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, “I am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.”",
            "Abrams cited the state’s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is “a failed governor, who doesn’t care about the people of Georgia.”",
            "In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state ― saying she had 51 others from which to choose.",
            "“If you don’t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,” he said. “If it’s the worst state, why are you here? Why don’t you leave ― go to another? There’s, what, 51 more other states that you can go to?”",
            "“Herschel misspoke ― he obviously knows there are 50 states,” spokeswoman Mallory Blount told HuffPost.",
            "Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements.",
            "He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn’t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he “never denied any of my kids.”",
            "Walker has also said he’s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist.",
            "“At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said in March.After the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, Walker called for “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media,” as a solution to curb school shootings, but it was not clear what that was or how it would solve the problem. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama also misspoke on the number of states.“It is wonderful to be back in Oregon,” Obama said. “Over the last 15 months, we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it.”He later said it was “a sign that my numeracy is getting a little, uh ―” before an aide cut him off. Some on took this comment as further proof of the birther conspiracy, claiming that he was actually referencing Muslim countries."

            "NEW YORK (AP) — The NFL and six of its teams have filed for arbitration in the lawsuit that alleges they engaged in racial discrimination. If the league’s request is successful, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell would be the arbitrator.",
            "The league and the teams filed papers late Tuesday with a judge presiding over a lawsuit that was filed by Brian Flores after he was fired in January as head coach of the Miami Dolphins. The NFL said employment agreements with teams signed by Flores and other coaches contain provisions that require the arbitration of all disputes.",
            "Flores now works as an assistant coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers. Two other Black coaches in the league — Steve Wilks and Ray Horton — joined Flores’ lawsuit, in which he alleges that the league engages in racist hiring practices despite its claims to the contrary.",
            "The NFL has insisted the lawsuit is “without merit,” although Goodell said before the Super Bowl that “all of the allegations, whether they were based on racism or discrimination or the integrity of our game, all of those to me were very disturbing.”",
            "A Manhattan federal judge is unlikely to rule on the arbitration issue until late summer at the earliest.",
            "David Gottlieb, a lawyer for the coaches, said Wednesday that moving the case to the secrecy of arbitration was, in effect, “stripping our clients of their rights.”",
            "“Arbitration is privatizing the judicial branch,” Gottlieb said. “All we’re asking for is an open and fair process.”",
            "He said lawyers for Flores and the other two coaches will argue that the lawsuit belongs in federal court because any agreements calling for arbitration were signed with the teams rather than the league.",
            "In March, Flores’ attorney Douglas Wigdor wrote a letter to Goodell, saying “arbitration is not transparent” and urging him to let the lawsuit stay before a judge.",
            "In its papers, the NFL argued that the discrimination lawsuit’s claims were not properly before the Manhattan court because multiple arbitration agreements signed by the coaches require arbitration.",
            "The league also defended its record on fighting discrimination, saying “diversity, equity and inclusion are core NFL values.” It cited its implementation nearly two decades ago of the “Rooney Rule,” which now requires teams to interview at least two minority candidates for any head coaching opening and at least one candidate in person.",
            "In his February lawsuit, Flores said the league remained “rife with racism” and continues to deny Black coaches positions for racial reasons, making it difficult for them to become general managers, head coaches, offensive and defensive coordinators and quarterbacks coaches in particular.",
            "His lawsuit sought class-action status and unspecified damages. In their papers, the league — along with the New York Giants, Miami Dolphins, Denver Broncos, Houston Texans, Arizona Cardinals and the Tennessee Titans — insisted that arbitration agreements will require the coaches to assert their claims individually.",
            "The filing came hours before a House committee released a document alleging Washington Commanders owner Dan Snyder conducted a “shadow investigation” to discredit former employees who claimed workplace sexual harassment. The document said private investigators were hired to intimidate witnesses and an overseas lawsuit was used as a pretext to obtain phone records and emails.",

            "The House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol attack held its fourth public hearing Tuesday, this time focusing on the intense pressure campaign led by former President Donald Trump as he scrambled to overturn the results of the 2020 election.",
            "Through live and recorded testimony, text messages, video and audio segments, the panel showed how the effort to keep Trump in power for another four years was extensive and unrelenting. Trump’s team took particular aim at fellow Republicans in swing states who might have been in positions to sway the final outcome, either by falsely revising the final tallies, meddling with the Electoral College or saying evidence of fraud had been found. But there was zero evidence of election fraud on a scale that could have affected the results.",
            "Fueled by the wrath of his supporters, Trump’s anger at having lost the election put him on a direct path to lighting the spark that ignited on Jan. 6, 2021, with the deadly attack on the Capitol building, according to the committee.",
            "Here are seven of the the biggest takeaways.",
            "Trump’s lawyers pressured Republican officials in swing states to overturn the election results but provided no proof of fraud.",
            "The committee presented evidence showing how Trump attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis aggressively lobbied officials in swing states, including Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia, to help them try to overturn the election results.",
            "In audio clips played at the hearing, Giuliani and Ellis can be heard calling Bryan Cutler, the Republican speaker of Pennsylvania’s state House of Representatives, several days in a row in late November.",
            "“I really have something important to call to your attention that I think really changes things,” Giuliani said in one call. According to the committee, Cutler found this inappropriate and directed his lawyers to tell Giuliani to stop calling, but Giuliani would not back down.",
            "Russel “Rusty” Bowers, the Republican speaker of Arizona’s state House of Representatives, said the pair put similar pressure on him. He recalled Giuliani telling him, “We’ve got lots of theories. We just don’t have the evidence.”",
            "The lawyers offered to provide evidence, Bowers testified, but never did.",
            "Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s Republican secretary of state, testified that his office tirelessly pursued allegations of election fraud, opening nearly 300 separate investigations, but came up empty. In one case, Trump’s team claimed that 66,000 underage voters were counted, but Raffensperger’s office found no evidence to back it up.",
            "“The numbers are the numbers. We investigated every allegation,” Raffensperger testified. He said his team “ran down the rabbit trail to make sure our numbers were accurate.”",
            "Trump had infamously told the Georgia official he needed to “find” just enough votes for Trump to win the state. On Tuesday, Raffensperger testified: “What I knew is we didn’t have any votes to find. There were no votes to find.”",
            "A mother-daughter duo of Georgia election workers described how their lives were affected by Trump’s targeted attacks.",
            "Ruby Freeman, who said she used to go by Lady Ruby, was a poll worker in Georgia during the 2020 election. She and her daughter, Wandrea “Shaye” Moss, found themselves personally attacked by Trump and his supporters in the wake of the election as Trump repeatedly fueled the idea that the vote had been rigged against him.",
            "Moss testified with her mother sitting behind her. Portions of Freeman’s videotaped testimony were also played at the hearing. The women said their lives had been upended by abuse that came online and in person after Giuliani shared security camera footage of the pair counting ballots. Trump’s team accused the women of counting “suitcases” of fake ballots that favored Biden.",
            "“Nowhere. There is nowhere I feel safe. Do you know how it feels to have the president of the United States target you? The president of the United States is supposed to represent every American, not to target one,” Freeman said in her recorded testimony. She left her home for two months in early 2021 amid the harassment, which included death threats.",
            "Freeman added: “But he targeted me, Lady Ruby. A proud American citizen who stood up to help Fulton County run an election in the middle of a pandemic.”",
            "Moss said she felt guilty for exposing her family to so much hate: “I felt bad for picking this job, for always being the one who wants to help.”",
            "She also cleared up an accusation Giuliani made that she and Freeman were passing a USB drive back and forth while working. It was nothing but a ginger mint, she said.",
            "Trump supporters flooded other officials with messages telling them to say Trump had won a second term ― or else.",
            "Michigan’s state Senate majority leader, Mike Shirkey, a Republican, said that after Trump publicly shared his phone number, he received around 4,000 text messages.",
            "Bowers said his office in Arizona was inundated with phone calls, emails and text messages from Trump supporters, making it hard for his staff to communicate with one another.",
            "The pressure on Bowers led to personal attacks at his home, where his adult daughter was dying of a chronic illness.",
            "During his testimony, Gabriel Sterling, Georgia’s voter system implementation manager, was asked about angry and impassioned remarks he made before the attack on the Capitol, warning that somebody was going to get hurt if the personal attacks on his colleagues didn’t stop.",
            "The Republican official said the “straw that broke the camel’s back” came after Trump supporters began targeting a contractor who worked for Dominion Voting Systems. Someone Sterling normally regarded as “pretty unflappable” called to tell him about it.",
            "“I did pull up Twitter. I scroll through it, and there’s a particular tweet,” Sterling testified. “It had his name, ‘You’ve committed treason. May God have mercy on your soul.’ And a slowly twisting GIF of a noose.”",
            "The attackers also turned to Raffensperger. He testified that Trump supporters threatened his wife with sexual violence and that some had broken into the home of his daughter-in-law, a widow with two children.",
            "Trump said Bowers agreed the election was rigged. Bowers said that’s not true.",
            "Bowers refuted a statement Trump sent Tuesday just before the hearing began in which he claimed the Arizona lawmaker told him he supported the idea that the 2020 presidential election had been “stolen.”",
            "“I did have a conversation with the president, but that certainly isn’t it,” Bowers testified, adding he never called it a rigged election to “anyone, anywhere, anytime.”",
            "Trump claimed the opposite in his statement, writing that Bowers “told me that the election was rigged and that I won Arizona.”",
            "Trump allies, including Rep. Andy Biggs, pressured Bowers to decertify Arizona’s slate of electors.",
            "John Eastman, a lawyer for Trump, told Bowers to just hold a vote to decertify Arizona’s electors “and let the courts sort it out.” Bowers testified that he replied: “You are asking me to do something that’s never been done in the history of the United States.”",
            "Bowers also testified that Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) called him the morning of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol while a joint session of Congress met to count the electoral votes.",
            "“He asked if I would sign on both to a letter that had been sent from my state and/or that I would support a decertification of the electors, and I said I would not,” Bowers said of his conversation with Biggs. Other witnesses have told the committee Biggs was closely involved in planning the rally that led to the Capitol riot.",
            "Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) allegedly tried to give Vice President Mike Pence a fake slate of pro-Trump electors.",
            "Damning text messages displayed at the hearing revealed that, shortly before Vice President Mike Pence was scheduled to certify the election results, Johnson aide Sean Riley contacted Pence staffer Chris Hodgson to say the senator wanted to “hand” Pence an “alternate slate of electors for [Michigan] and [Wisconsin] because the archivist didn’t receive them.”",
            "Hodgson responded: “Do not give that to him.”",
            "A representative of Johnson, who is running for reelection in Wisconsin, issued a statement Tuesday saying the senator “had no involvement in the creation of an alternate slate of electors and had no foreknowledge that it was going to be delivered to our office. This was a staff to staff exchange. His new Chief of Staff contacted the Vice President’s office.”",
            "Trump and his team allegedly solicited help from the RNC to push its “alternate” elector scheme.",
            "Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel shared details of a potentially damning phone conversation Trump initiated. The former president called her, she said, and then handed the phone to Eastman, who pressured her to help with the plan to install pro-Trump electors. The committee showed video of testimony in which she described the call and the aid the RNC would give.",
            "“Essentially, he turned the call over to Mr. Eastman, who then proceeded to talk about the importance of the RNC helping the campaign gather these contingent electors in case any of the legal challenges that were ongoing changed the result of any of the states,” McDaniel said."

            "Ginni Thomas, the wife of conservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, reportedly attended a meeting of a group involved in spreading election lies two months after a violent mob stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
            "Thomas attended a group meeting headlined by pastor and conservative radio host C.L. Bryant on March 6, 2021, in which Bryant openly questioned President Joe Biden’s 2020 election win, according to a video recording of the event reviewed by The Washington Post.",
            "“There is a robbery that is going on in this country right now,” Bryant said at the Frontliners for Liberty event. “In fact, I say it to you and I’ll say it loud and clear, and I’m not ashamed to say it. I won’t bite my tongue. I do believe that Donald John Trump is the only legitimate president.”",
            "The Post also said a photo from that meeting shows Thomas posing with Bryant.",
            "In December 2020, Thomas invited John Eastman, a lawyer advising former President Donald Trump on his efforts to overturn the election, to speak before the same group to provide “an update about election litigation to a group she met with periodically,” Eastman wrote on his Substack, attaching a copy of the email Thomas sent to him.",
            "The Post spoke to members of Frontliners for Liberty who described the group as a “loose-knit coalition of conservative activists” that is confidential.",
            "Last week, the Post reported the House panel was in possession of emails exchanged between the two, citing sources saying the correspondence was evidence that Thomas was more involved than previously known in interfering with the election results.",
            "This prompted the committee to send an invitation to Thomas to testify, Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) told reporters Thursday.",
            "The email Eastman published appears to be part of the 170 documents a California judge ordered the lawyer to turn over to the committee, including 10 documents that the judge wrote were related to three meetings held in December 2020 by a group supporting Trump, according to NBC News.",
            "“Four documents pertain to a meeting on Dec. 8, 2020: two emails are the group’s high-profile leader inviting Dr. Eastman to speak at the meeting, and two contain the meeting’s agenda,” U.S. District Judge David Carter said.",
            "Carter ruled the House panel “has a substantial interest in these three meetings because the presentations furthered a critical objective of the January 6 plan: to have contested states certify alternate slates of electors for President Trump.”",
            "The communications between Thomas and Eastman also point out a direct conflict of interest for her husband, who did not recuse himself from cases related to the Capitol riot.",
            "Justice Clarence Thomas was the only dissent in a case before the court involving claims of executive privilege by Trump and some of his officials about documents requested by the Jan. 6 committee. Among those officials was Mark Meadows, with whom Ginni Thomas exchanged text messages urging him to continue fighting the election result.",
            "Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.) on Thursday called on Clarence Thomas to resign following reports on his wife’s conduct.",
            "“And while she was doing all this, her husband, Justice Clarence Thomas, was hearing litigation relating to the 2020 election,” Pascrell wrote, calling Thomas “a corrupt jurist who has poisoned the High Court.”",
            "Eastman, who clerked for Clarence Thomas, strongly denies having any conversations with Ginni Thomas about Supreme Court cases.",
            "“I can categorically confirm that at no time did I discuss with Mrs. Thomas or Justice Thomas any matters pending or likely to come before the Court,” Eastman wrote on his Substack. “We have never engaged in such discussions, would not engage in such discussions, and did not do so in December 2020 or anytime else.”",
            "In an interview with Washington Free Beacon in March, Ginni Thomas said she does not interfere with her husband’s work on the court.",
            "“Clarence doesn’t discuss his work with me, and I don’t involve him in my work,” she said.",
            "Eastman was also the subject of the committee’s third public hearing, which showed he was involved in crafting a fake electors scheme that would block Biden’s win, even though he knew it was illegal."

            "LOS ANGELES (AP) — A settlement agreement has been reached on the eve of a second trial pitting the Kardashian family against former reality TV star Blac Chyna.",
            "Jury selection had been set to begin Monday in the trial over Chyna's allegations that her former fiance Rob Kardashian maliciously posted nude photos of her in 2017 after their tumultuous breakup, but according to court documents, the parties informed the judge that they had agreed to a settlement.",
            "Emails to attorneys for both sides seeking comment and details on the terms of the settlement were not immediately returned.",
            "A trial had seemed a virtual certainty after the judge last week denied a motion by Kardashian's attorneys to enforce a settlement agreement they said the two sides had reached.",
            "The trial was to be a sequel of sorts to a defamation trial earlier this year in which Chyna, whose legal name is Angela White, alleged that Kardashian's mother and sisters — Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Khloé Kardashian and Kylie Jenner — had defamed her as violent and unstable, and persuaded producers and executives to cancel her reality show, “Rob & Chyna.”",
            "The Kardashians won a clear-cut victory in that trial May 2. The four women had attended most of the proceedings, and all four testified, though they were in New York at the Met Gala when the verdict was read.",
            "Rob Kardashian, who has a daughter with Chyna, was not a defendant in that trial, but he gave often angry and sometimes sad testimony about the late-night fight that led to the end of their relationship.",
            "Chyna had initially filed one lawsuit against the whole family, but the judge ruled that the allegations against Rob — which also included assault accusations — should get their own trial. Fewer members of the famous family had been expected to attend the second trial, and only Rob and Kris Kardashian had been expected to testify.",
            "At the first trial, jurors found that the Kardashians acted in bad faith in their conversations about the couple's troubles with producers of “Rob & Chyna” and executives from the E! network, which aired it. But they found that it had no substantial effect on Chyna’s contract or the fate of the show, and she was awarded no damages.",
            "Chyna’s attorney Lynne Ciani said after the verdict that she and her client were disappointed but felt vindicated by the jury's findings, which she said demonstrated that Chyna had not physically abused Rob, and validated their claim that the Kardashian women had attempted to interfere with her contract to be on the show.",

            "Chappelle said during the ceremony that he declined the honor because he did not want his name to distract from students’ work.",
            "The Duke Ellington School of the Arts decided to rename the theater after Chappelle last year and scheduled a fundraiser in November. But the school postponed the event after controversy escalated following Chappelle’s Netflix special “The Closer,” which included graphic jokes about transgender women and the LGBTQ community.",

            "Former President Donald Trump continues to push for single-day, in-person voting in elections — prohibiting mail-in ballots and early voting that 69% of American voters used in 2020.",
            "Despite the risk of slashing voter rolls by making casting a ballot far more difficult, Trump called last week at a Nashville convention for “same-day voting.”",
            "“Ultimately, we want same-day voting — one day — and only paper ballots,” Trump said to cheers.",
            "Trump has justified the GOP push for more difficult and restrictive voting by claiming it will protect against the kind of rigged election he insists occurred in 2020 — which has proven to be a lie. Ironically, Trump, who has baselessly claimed mail ballots are “corrupt,” votes by mail.",
            "Critics say Trump’s goal is to significantly decrease the number of votes, which is generally considered beneficial to Republicans. One user on Twitter quipped that Trump is running on a platform urging: “Don’t count all the votes.”",
            "Trump said on Fox News in 2020 that “you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again” if “voting levels” were expanded. (Research has shown, however, that mail-in ballots don’t appear to give either party a distinct advantage.)",
            "Witnesses who testified at last week’s hearings before the House select committee investigating the insurrection, said that Trump wanted to shut down voting and not count anymore ballots while he was still ahead on election night. He tweeted the following morning: “Stop the count!”",
            "But that’s not the way elections work.",
            "Former Fox News political editor Chris Stirewalt testified about the “red mirage” when Republicans tend to be ahead in the evening of an election day before late and mail-in votes are counted, and catch up to, and often surpass, the early leaders.",
            "Trump, however, declared that night before all the votes were tallied: “Frankly, we did win this election.”",
            "The U.S. Census Department reported that in the 2020 election 69% of American voters nationwide cast their ballot “nontraditionally” — by mail and/or before Election Day.",
            "Early and mail-in voting have tremendously increased the convenience of casting a ballot, allowing and encouraging more people to vote. For example, homebound and bed-ridden citizens can now easily vote by mail.",
            "Early voting and mail-in ballots also aid people who work long hours or multiple jobs, or are juggling child care and are not able to get to polling spots before they close. Many employers don’t allow extra time to vote. Voters also no longer have to drive long distances to rural polling places on one particular day.",
            "Trump’s plan completely overlooks Americans abroad, including employees working overseas, service members and staff of diplomatic postings, who mail in their ballots.",

            "It can be hard to jump-start your brain and body without a morning jolt of coffee.",
            "But you might have noticed caffeine makes you feel increasingly jittery, or you may have a health condition that requires you to reduce or eliminate caffeine from your diet. So what can you do to get yourself off to a good start while avoiding that 10 a.m. out-of-sorts feeling? Here are some smart thoughts from nutrition experts.",
            "“Some people, like me, are sensitive to caffeine,” said nutritional wellness chef Marshall O’Brien. “I get really anxious and stressed, and I find it affects my focus and calmness.” For O’Brien, the answer is to drink green tea, which has about one-third as much caffeine as coffee. “It also has a calming amino acid called L-theanine, and there have been studies showing some increases in focus,” O’Brien said. Another green tea fan is registered dietician nutritionist Vicki Shanta Retelny. “It’s much lower in caffeine than coffee, and it’s got a whole host of flavonoids, which are phenolic compounds that work wonders in the body,” she said.",
            "Start by being aware of how much caffeine you’re taking in from all sources throughout your day. The general recommendation is no more than 400 mg per day, the equivalent of four to five cups of brewed coffee. Remember that while those guidelines can be helpful, your mileage on the Caffeine Car may vary.",
            "“Some people metabolize caffeine more slowly than others,” explained registered dietitian nutritionist Amy Gorin. “If they consume too much caffeine in too short of a time frame, they’re more likely to experience side effects like jitters.”",
            "And keep in mind that not all cups of coffee are created equally. “Starbucks coffee, for instance, tends to be higher in caffeine than what you brew at home,” Gorin added. Registered dietitian nutritionist Marissa Meshulam said, “If you feel really sensitive, I’d recommend avoiding cold-brew coffee, since it’s much stronger than traditionally brewed coffee.”",
            "Pay attention to which sort of roast you like best, too. “Dark roast coffee has less caffeine than lighter roasts, so move toward the darker varieties with deeper flavors if you need to cut back on caffeine,” said registered dietitian nutritionist Amanda Frankeny.",
            "Another way to keep yourself calmer is to start your day differently, especially if you tend to stagger to the coffee pot before you’re even fully awake. “Delay having coffee for at least an hour after you wake up in the morning,” suggested registered dietitian nutritionist Jerlyn Jones. “Drink a glass of water instead.”",
            "“Even though coffee has now been linked to health benefits, such as glucose lowering and liver protection, it’s important to keep it in balance if you want to experience the positive effects without the negative ones,” registered dietitian nutritionist Sharon Palmer said. Instead of going “cold turkey,” she suggested starting out with small changes, like going from two cups in the morning to one cup. O’Brien suggested this approach: “Start with regular coffee, then blend half decaf into your mix. Then you could try black tea, then green tea.”",
            "Jones is a fan of matcha green tea, which she said is “loaded with antioxidants and has a fresh, earthy flavor.” Another herbal alternative is golden milk, which Jones described as “a rich, caffeine-free substitute for coffee.” Here’s a vegan golden milk recipe from Minimalist Baker.",
            "As you’re making your way into eliminating or lowering caffeine consumption, keep in mind these thoughts from Frankeny: “Plan ahead for the first couple days of caffeine withdrawal. Don’t schedule it over your best friend’s birthday weekend, because this kind of detox might bring out the worst in you. Have pain relievers on hand, if needed. Warn the people you love or work with about what’s happening, just in case they notice your physical pain or you becoming short with them. The caffeine is to blame, not them.”",
            "Ready for some morning alternatives that go easy on caffeine? Here are some expert suggestions.",

            "Former Watergate prosecutor Nick Akerman said there is a rock-solid case against Donald Trump in the Georgia criminal probe into the former president’s demand that a state official “find” him more votes after the 2020 election.",
            "During an interview on MSNBC’s “The Katie Phang Show” on Sunday, Akerman said Trump could likely face an indictment as a Fulton County grand jury investigates his attempt to steal the vote in Georgia.",
            "In a recorded call from Trump to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger ahead of the official 2020 vote certification, Trump told the election official to “find” the 11,780 votes needed to reverse his loss to Joe Biden in the state. Akerman, who served as an assistant special prosecutor during the Watergate scandal that led to the resignation of former President Richard Nixon, said he believed that tape would be enough to lead to a possible conviction.“If you are asking which of the cases right now, which one is going to send Donald Trump to prison, that is the case,” he said. “There is a really neat three-year felony in Georgia, that Donald Trump has violated. Prosecutors love tape-recorded evidence because you cannot cross-examine it.”“What is significant with those tapes is that when you put it in context of all of the evidence that the January 6 committee has uncovered — you put that together, Donald Trump has zero defense in Georgia,” he added.“If I had to put my money on one prosecution that’s going to go forward here that will send Donald Trump to jail — it’s Georgia.”Trump may have violated several federal laws in his call with Raffensperger. Georgia state law also makes it a crime to willfully tamper with “any electors list, voter’s certificate, numbered list of voters, ballot box, voting machine, direct recording electronic (DRE) equipment, or tabulating machine” or to solicit another person to commit such a felony, punishable by a sentence of up to three years in prison.Trump’s only potential defense would be to “somehow pick up on some ambiguity in the tape, that he did not really mean what he said,” Akerman noted, though he doesn’t think that will stand up.“Put in the context about the January 6th committee has found, I think they have gotten a case beyond a reasonable doubt,” he said.The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol has laid out damning evidence from thousands of hours of testimony and tens of thousands of pages of documents in hearings this month that create a picture of how Trump and his allies spread falsehoods about the 2020 election and tried to overturn the results despite knowing the accusations were untrue.Trump has argued his conversation with Raffensperger was “PERFECT and appropriate.”"

            "Summer means families are more spending time in and around the water: Pool parties, beach days and boat rides are all more common this time of year.",
            "As temperatures heat up, brushing up on water safety is crucial for everyone, but particularly for parents of young kids. According to the CDC, drowning is the second leading cause of death for kids ages 1 to 4.",
            "In addition to educating yourself on drowning prevention (more on that below), there’s a little-known factor to consider when taking your kids swimming this summer — the color of their bathing suits.",
            "Alive Solutions, a company specializing in water safety, conducted an informal study in 2020 to test how visible different colored swimsuits would be in light-bottomed pools, dark-bottomed pools and lakes. For the pools, they tested what the suits looked like underwater (top row) and then again with some surface agitation (bottom row) from the perspective of a person standing on the pool deck.",
            "For the lake, the company tested the different swimsuit colors on the surface of the water (top row), from a shore view (middle row) and from an elevated view (bottom row) to simulate what it would look if the parent were standing on a boat or a dock. The water was only 18 inches deep.",
            "“We do drowning investigations and know that visibility is important in drowning recognition,” Natalie Livingston, co-founder of Alive Solutions, told HuffPost. “As lifeguards and aquatics professionals, we know that there are certain factors that can make someone easier or more challenging to see in the water.”",
            "“Knowing this as our background, we started to look at swimwear for our kids and realized that so many parents were selecting swimwear that was super cute and fashionable, but would cause their children to potentially disappear under the water,” she said.",
            "Neon colors that provide contrast performed the best in both pools and lakes. For light-bottomed pools, neon pink and neon orange stood out the most, while white and light blue suits stood out the least. Dark colors like purple and black could be seen well but are not recommended, as they could be mistaken for dirt, leaves or a shadow.",
            "For lakes and dark-bottomed pools, neon orange, neon green and neon yellow were the most visible. Notably, neon pink did not perform well in the lake setting. White was visible in that environment but could easily be confused for light reflection on the surface of the water, so it isn’t recommended.",
            "“The goal was really to show others how to stay more visible and also how water is challenging to look through. It is not like looking through air,” Livingston said. “Overall, neons came out in the lead in all categories.”",
            "It’s also worth noting that in the lake setting, at two feet of depth, visibility went down to zero for all the colors tested — a good reminder about the importance of wearing life jackets in open-water environments since they keep swimmers at the surface. (Note: Unlike life vests, water wings, tubes, baby circles and other inflatables are not considered safety devices.)",
            "Kids ages 5 and under should also wear life jackets in pools if they’re not protected by “touch supervision,” which means a caregiver is “within an arm’s reach of the child at all times,” according to the National Drowning Prevention Alliance.",
            "The color of your child’s bathing suit is of little importance if other safety measures aren’t being taken.",
            "Mario Vittone, a former Coast Guard rescue swimmer and drowning expert, said that considering the visibility of swimsuit colors in pools is “not a bad idea” and that avoiding white and blue ones is a good call. But he wouldn’t go so far as to say neon-colored suits are “safer.”",
            "“If the color of the suit comes into play, then the drowning has probably already occurred. Being able to easily spot the kid laying on the bottom is good, but it is significantly less good than never letting them get to the bottom in the first place,” Vittone told HuffPost.",
            "“A child in a light blue bathing suit that has had swim lessons and is swimming in a well-guarded pool is an order of magnitude safer than a child in a hot neon yellow suit who hasn’t had swim lessons in a pool guarded by one lifeguard who never takes breaks.”",
            "Indeed, getting your child swim lessons at a young age can reduce their risk of drowning. Make sure you have a good understanding of your child’s swimming abilities — and your own skill level, too.",
            "But as the American Academy of Pediatrics noted, “even advanced swimming skills will not always prevent drowning” and “swimming lessons must be considered only within the context of multilayered protection.”",
            "Constant, careful, undistracted adult supervision is absolutely essential when kids are in and around the water. Drowning happens very quickly — sometimes in a matter of seconds — so even looking away to quickly check your phone or grab a snack can be dangerous.",
            "“Watch — with your eyes — the children in the water, the entire time they are in the water,” Vittone said, while also recommending that adults watch any lifeguards present for about 15 minutes to determine how attentive they’re being.",
            "Having an adult act as the designated “water watcher” is a good idea, too. Just be sure to switch off who’s on duty every 15 minutes or so to give each other breaks and to stay sharp.",
            "“When everybody is watching, nobody is watching,” pediatrician and former lifeguard Dr. Sarah Denny recently told HuffPost. “We see this all the time: A whole group of adults [is] around and a child drowns, and it’s not anyone’s fault, but it’s just [that] everyone assumes everyone else is watching.”",
            "Drowning can be difficult to recognize, so it’s important to know what to look for. It doesn’t look like the thrashing, splashing, yelling-for-help depictions that you’ve seen in movies. As Vittone wrote in a viral post on his website, it’s “almost always a deceptively quiet event.”",
            "“Children playing in the water make noise. When they get quiet, you get to them and find out why,” he wrote.",
            "Look for signs like the child’s head tilted back and low in the water with their mouth open at water level. Other signs include gasping for air, hair covering their face, and eyes that are open, glassy and empty or tightly shut. The swimmer may also look like they’re trying to climb an invisible ladder.",
            "Another important precaution: Add barriers like a four-sided fence with a self-closing and self-latching gate around a pool or hot tub to restrict access.",
            "“If your home represents the fourth side of the pool, make sure you have a door alarm, so you’re alerted if your child leaves the home,” Consumer Product Safety Commission spokesperson Nikki Fleming previously told HuffPost. “In addition, you can also use a pool alarm that will signal an alarm if the child were to actually enter the water.”",
            "Learning CPR can be another life-saving tool to add to your arsenal. When dealing with a drowning victim, experts recommend you start by giving rescue breaths.",
            "“It is not normal, layperson, compression-only CPR,” Livingston said. “Drowning care first starts with air — time without oxygen is critical in the outcome, so giving breaths first is so important.”",
            "You can find trainings in your community or online via the Red Cross and other organizations.",

            "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Four months of brutal fighting in Ukraine appear to be straining the morale of troops on both sides, prompting desertions and rebellion against officers’ orders, British defense officials said Sunday. NATO’s chief warned the war could drag on for “years.”",
            "“Combat units from both sides are committed to intense combat in the Donbas and are likely experiencing variable morale,” Britain’s defense ministry said in its daily assessment of the war.",
            "“Ukrainian forces have likely suffered desertions in recent weeks,” the assessment said, but added that “Russian morale highly likely remains especially troubled.”",
            "It said “cases of whole Russian units refusing orders and armed stand-offs between officers and their troops continue to occur.”",
            "Separately, the Ukrainian Main Intelligence Directorate released what it said were intercepted phone calls in which Russian soldiers complained about frontline conditions, poor equipment, and overall lack of personnel, according to a report by the Institute for the Study of War.",
            "In an interview published on Sunday in the German weekly Bild am Sonntag, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that “nobody knows” how long the war could last. “We need to be prepared for it to last for years,” he said.",
            "He also urged allies ”not to weaken support for Ukraine, even if the costs are high, not only in terms of military aid, but also because of the increase in energy and food goods prices.”",
            "In recent days, Gazprom, the Russian gas company, has reduced supplies to two major European clients — Germany and Italy. In Italy’s case, energy officials are expected to huddle this week about the situation. The head of Italian energy giant ENI said on Saturday that with additional gas purchased from other sources, Italy should make it through the coming winter, but he warned Italians that “restrictions” affecting gas use might be necessary.",
            "Germany will limit the use of gas for electricity production amid concerns about possible shortages caused by a reduction in supplies from Russia, the country’s economy minister said on Sunday. Germany has been trying to fill its gas storage facilities to capacity ahead of the cold winter months.",
            "Economy Minister Robert Habeck said that Germany will try to compensate for the move by increasing the burning of coal, a more polluting fossil fuel. “That’s bitter, but it’s simply necessary in this situation to lower gas usage,” he said.",
            "Stoltenberg stressed, though, that “the costs of food and fuel are nothing compared with those paid daily by the Ukrainians on the front line.”",
            "Stoltenberg added: What’s more, if Russian President Vladimir Putin should reach his objectives in Ukraine, like when he annexed Crimea in 2014, “we would have to pay an even greater price.”",
            "Britain’s defense ministry said that both Russia and Ukraine have continued to conduct heavy artillery bombardments on axes to the north, east and south of the Sieverodonetsk pocket, but with little change in the front line.",
            "Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai said via Telegram on Sunday: “It is a very difficult situation in Sievierodonetsk, where the enemy in the middle of the city is conducting round-the-clock aerial reconnaissance with drones, adjusting fire, quickly adjusting to our changes.”",
            "Russia’s defense ministry claimed on Sunday that Russian and separatist forces have taken control of Metolkine, a settlement just to the east of Sievierodonetsk.",
            "On Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made a trip south from Kyiv to visit troops and hospital workers in the Mykolaiv and Odesa regions along the Black Sea. He handed out awards to dozens of people at every stop, shaking their hands and thanking them again and again for their service.",
            "Some time after Zelenskyy left Mykolaiv, “the enemy carried out fire damage against units of the Defense Forces with cannon and rocket artillery in the areas of the settlements of Pravdyne, Posad-Pokrovskoe and Blahodatne,” according to the Ukrainian army briefing on Sunday.",
            "In other attacks in the south, Ukraine’s southern military operational command said on Sunday that two people were killed in shelling of the Galitsyn community in the Mykolaiv region and that shelling of the Bashtansky district is continuing.",
            "Russia’s defense ministry said seaborne missiles destroyed a plant in Mykolaiv city where Western-supplied howitzers and armored vehicles were stored.",
            "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has expressed concerns “that a bit of Ukraine fatigue is starting to set in around the world” and has urged support for Ukrainian efforts to try to roll back the Russian invasion.",
            "“It would be a catastrophe if Putin won. He’d love nothing more than to say, ‘Let’s freeze this conflict, let’s have a cease-fire,’” Johnson said on Saturday, a day after a surprise visit to Kyiv, where he met with Zelenskyy and offered offer continued aid and military training.",
            "Western-supplied heavy weapons are reaching front lines. But Ukraine’s leaders have insisted for weeks that they need more arms and they need them sooner.",
            "On Sunday Pope Francis, despite having lamented arms build-ups, added his own admonition to those who might lose focus on Ukraine, which he has said deserves to defend itself.",
            "“And let’s not forget the martyred Ukrainian people in this moment,” Francis told the public in St. Peter’s Square. He prodded them to ask themselves ”’What did I do today for the Ukrainian people?”"

            "A few months after Massachusetts became the first state to recognize same-sex marriage, a college senior in Michigan wrote an essay on why his church should do the same.",
            "In 2004, Joseph Kuilema was getting ready to graduate from Calvin College, an affiliate of the U.S. Christian Reformed Church that is based in Grand Rapids and has a few hundred thousand followers scattered mostly across the Upper Midwest. The CRC is a Protestant denomination that sees the Bible as “inspired and infallible” truth, while drawing upon three Reformation-era texts called “confessions” to explain what that truth means in real life.",
            "Among the lessons the CRC takes from these writings is its position on same-sex relationships. The CRC promotes love for gay members, calling past hostility toward the LGBTQ community “a great failing.” But it also deems homosexual behavior “incompatible” with Scripture because, in the church’s view, intimacy is a divine gift reserved for marriage between a man and a woman.",
            "The CRC first staked out that position in 1973. Kuilema, writing three decades later, explained why he thought it was wrong.",
            "In a paper that he called “Tuxes for Two” and submitted for a course on theological ethics, Kuilema highlighted what he saw as inconsistencies in CRC doctrine and argued for interpreting religious texts in the context of their times, which, he said, meant focusing on the nature of the loving, lifelong partnership the Bible celebrates rather than whether it is between a man and woman.",
            "“This is about … couples who are in love, devoted to God and the Christian faith, ready to embark on a lifelong journey of commitment and mutuality,” Kuilema wrote.",
            "Aggressively interrogating such widely accepted principles of faith would have qualified as rebellion at many Christian colleges. At Calvin, it was a tradition, with students following a tone set by the faculty. School policies explicitly allowed professors room to criticize elements of CRC orthodoxy as long as they agreed to conduct their lives according to the church’s rules. And in a long-running internal CRC debate over how to temper biblical writings with contemporary values, Calvin faculty were frequently among those pushing hardest for more progressive views.",
            "That environment is one reason that Kuilema returned to Calvin several years after graduation, to become a tenure-track professor in the social work department. As a researcher, he focused on the intersections between faith and activism. As a teacher, he directed study abroad programs in Liberia. He liked to speak out on issues related to race, once drawing the scorn of Tucker Carlson’s website, and became a visible ally to Calvin’s LGBTQ students, one of whom later came to him with a request.",
            "Nicole Sweda had gotten to know Kuilema when she was an openly queer undergraduate and had kept in touch with him afterward, when she got a full-time job at a research center that operated within the school. She was getting ready to wed her longtime girlfriend, and the two were hoping Kuilema could officiate the ceremony.",
            "Kuilema agreed, reasoning that it would be compliant with Calvin faculty rules because he wasn’t the one getting married ― and because the ceremony would be secular and on his own time. He checked with the elders at his Grand Rapids church, which is part of the CRC, as well as his department chair at Calvin. They said they were fine with it.",
            "But Kuilema had run afoul of Calvin officials before. In 2018, the Board of Trustees overruled a faculty recommendation and blocked his tenure, citing concerns over the “tone and substance” of past statements about the LGBTQ community. Kuilema had remained at Calvin afterward, working on a two-year renewable contract that was serving as a probationary period.",
            "Presiding at the wedding risked drawing more official ire. At the same time, Kuilema thought, there was a higher authority to consider ― and more important imperatives to follow.",
            "“For me, the religious question was not whether God approves of such unions, I think God absolutely does, but whether I would be faithful to God,” Kuilema told me recently, thinking back to why he decided to go ahead. “The question was whether I would practice what I preach and be willing to accept whatever consequences that might follow.”",
            "Those consequences would soon become clear ― and upend his life.",
            "In early December, about two months after the wedding and just as Kuilema’s newest reappointment was on the verge of approval, he was summoned to a meeting with the provost, Noah Toly. Somebody had sent Toly a photo of Kuilema officiating the wedding. When Kuilema confirmed that the image was authentic, he learned that his reappointment was on hold, pending a fuller investigation and discussion of whether that should affect his contract status.",
            "Kuilema wasn’t the only one facing consequences. In January, Sweda got a calendar invite for her own meeting with Toly, whom she had never met. There, Sweda told me later, officials asked her to verify her relationship status and told her that she was in violation of Calvin guidelines. Sweda said she hadn’t known the rules for staff prohibited same-sex relationships, then she asked nervously, “Am I being fired?”",
            "After a few more weeks, and while administrators were still weighing their options, a reporter for the student newspaper, Chimes, broke the story of Kuilema, the wedding and the possibility of employment repercussions, instantly turning the private matter into a public controversy and exposing deep rifts in the Calvin community over not just the fate of a student and beloved professor, but also the future of the institution itself. The story has since gone national, with coverage in several religion and higher-education publications.",
            "The controversy at Calvin has a lot in common with disputes elsewhere in the U.S., including an ongoing fight over anti-gay hiring policies that has divided students, faculty and trustees at Seattle Pacific University, a medium-sized Christian college, as well as a possible split of the United Methodist Church into two denominations, one recognizing same-sex marriage and one continuing to reject it.",
            "And there are echoes of fights playing out in other contexts, including the political debates over classroom discussion of sexual orientation in Florida and over transgender athletes competing in collegiate sports. The same underlying tensions are also at the heart of a lawsuit, pending in federal court, over a special exemption that allows religious schools to collect federal education funds even if they have policies that discriminate against LGBTQ students or faculty.",
            "The thread running through all these controversies is a clash between the traditional and the modern ― between those who think their worlds have already changed too much and those who want them to change more ― over a whole set of cultural issues but especially over those related to sexuality. And at Calvin, it’s fast becoming an existential crisis, with newer generations of students and many faculty pushing the school to accept and embrace the LBGTQ community more firmly while outside forces pull in the opposite direction.",
            "Among those outside forces are some wealthy donors and alumni, including at least one with ties to the DeVos-Prince family, one of the most influential financiers of conservative politics in the U.S. Another source of pressure are parents of Calvin students, specifically the ones who expect the school to shield their kids from a culture they believe promotes LGBTQ behavior.",
            "Then there’s the CRC itself, whose governing congress, the Synod, this week voted to elevate its position on LGBTQ matters from “pastoral guidance” (which effectively allows some room for questioning and dissent) to “confessional” status (which doesn't). A number of Calvin professors have already threatened to leave if the vote leads to change in school policies.",
            "In the past, Calvin’s leaders have frequently tried to find a middle ground on issues related to sexuality by talking up academic freedom even as they pledged fealty to biblical authority, and by preaching love even as their policies condemned the behavior of LGBTQ students.",
            "Today that middle ground feels less stable than ever. Many in and around Calvin wonder how much longer it can hold and fear what the school will become if it doesn’t.",
            "The first time I met Joe Kuilema was in early May, at a coffee shop about two miles from campus. He is tall and slender, with a full beard and bald head, and as he sat across from me in a booth to tell his story, he talked with an animated enthusiasm that made it easy to understand why undergraduates voted him “teacher of the year” in 2019.",
            "The eatery had a hipster feel, with exposed brick walls, hardwood floors and industrial track lighting. Nothing about the scene would have felt out of place in Cambridge or Berkeley, or in Ann Arbor, for that matter, although there are reasons that Kuilema’s academic trajectory took him instead to Grand Rapids — and to Calvin. One of those reasons is faith. Another is family.",
            "Kuilema’s lineage traces back to the Dutch immigrants who settled in western Michigan in the 19th and early 20th centuries and today remain a dominant presence in that part of the state. The first wave established the CRC to carry on the traditions of the churches they had known in the Netherlands and established a Calvin seminary to train clergy who could lead services in their native language. Later, school administrators broadened the academic mission and spun off the non-ministerial division, which became Calvin College ― and more recently, Calvin University ― although the close relationship to the CRC remained. To this day, the church has direct governing responsibility over the college, plus it supplies a portion of the operating budget.",
            "But historically Calvin administrators haven’t tried to wall the school off from the outside world in the way some other Christian colleges have ― which is why, in the late 1960s, some of the turmoil that was roiling the rest of America seeped into the Calvin campus. Among those caught up in it were Kuilema’s parents, who met when they were both undergraduates and whom Kuilema described as “long-haired hippies.” His father once helped produce a spoof of the official CRC newspaper that featured a drawing of the famous Iwo Jima flag-raising but with a giant dollar bill instead of the Stars and Stripes on the pole.",
            "Several years and a few haircuts later, Kuilema’s father came back to Calvin as an employee, serving in a variety of high-ranking administrative roles. But neither he nor Kuilema’s mother ever stopped pushing for change ― in the world, in the church or on campus. One of Kuilema’s most vivid childhood memories is from 1990, when he would have been 8 years old, and his mother was participating in a demonstration to protest the CRC’s traditional prohibition on women holding leadership roles in churches. Kuilema and his two sisters went along, sitting in delegate chairs, holding lighted candles and singing along with the protest chants.",
            "Years later, the CRC’s Synod officially adopted a new position that gave individual churches discretion over whether to accept women leaders, though it would take 12 more years before they let women vote on denominational decisions. Kuilema says that watching his parents made a big impression and led directly to his professional choices.",
            "“My father’s trajectory from radical student protesting Vietnam and publishing subversive magazines to respected Calvin employee was part of what convinced me that there was room for someone like me at Calvin,” he said.",
            "When Kuilema was getting ready to join the Calvin faculty, in 2008, he mentioned his belief that the CRC should support same-sex marriage. The dean responded by noting that many other Calvin professors felt the same way. Which wasn’t surprising.",
            "A small but growing minority of religious scholars from across Christian faiths had been arguing that the anti-LGBTQ reading of Scripture was too literal and too selective. Several found a home at Calvin, where professors have long had license to engage in wide-ranging debates, even those touching directly on issues of faith.",
            "But professors also sign pledges to live by the CRC’s rules for conduct. They aren’t supposed to challenge the CRC’s most fundamental beliefs. And although there’s a lot of disagreement over exactly where that line is, sometimes professors have gotten into trouble because the administration believed they had crossed it.",
            "In 2009, a pair of religion professors published a paper stating that fossil records made it impossible to believe a biblical Adam and Eve had been exiled from a garden paradise, effectively calling into question the CRC’s understanding of original sin. Among those who expressed outrage was Gaylen Byker, who was president of Calvin back then and also happened to be a prominent Republican Party donor. One of the paper co-authors ended up leaving, under undisclosed terms, prompting one school critic to write in the Chronicle of Education that the episode had “stained” Calvin’s reputation.",
            "A major controversy over the treatment of the LGBTQ community had started just a few years before, over a play called “Seven Passages” that was about LGBTQ life in conservative Christian communities in the Midwest. The author was Stephanie Sandberg, a Calvin theater professor. She’d gotten the idea for it after meeting with a distraught undergraduate who was afraid to tell his parents that he was gay. While working on it, she told me, she was careful to keep her faculty superiors informed of her work and to underwrite the project with independent funding.",
            "“Seven Passages” played to a month of sold-out shows at a Grand Rapids theater. Calvin faculty attended, including some who were also part of a panel on LGBTQ issues that Sandberg moderated on campus. A production company even decided to make a film version. But an outraged CRC pastor in Iowa wrote Calvin officials and the elders at Sandberg’s Grand Rapids church, accusing her of violating church orthodoxy.",
            "The Board of Trustees responded with a statement saying that “advocacy of homosexual practice and same-sex marriage is not permitted” ― and stood by its pronouncement even after 36 to 4 vote in the Faculty Senate calling on the trustees to withdraw it.",
            "Over the next few years, a college working group produced a series of new guidelines for faculty behavior that made a point of recognizing the need for academic freedom. But it also called on professors to check in with their academic superiors whenever their work might question or undermine core CRC beliefs.",
            "It’s impossible to understand the controversies at Calvin without recognizing how rapidly the world around it has changed and how threatening those changes feel to some parts of the school’s community. Nicole Sweda has seen both parts of that story.",
            "She arrived for her first year in 2016. The U.S. Supreme Court had just made same-sex marriage the law of the land, with the public strongly approving. Car companies and other retailers were sponsoring Pride events and targeting gay customers with ads. It was no longer a big deal to see openly gay figures in business, politics or professional sports ― and at Sweda’s large public high school in Rochester Hills, an upscale Detroit suburb, it wasn’t a big deal, either.",
            "“Honestly, I didn’t feel like anybody cared,” Sweda told me. “Freshman or sophomore year, you’d sometimes hear people still say, ‘That’s so gay’ or whatever, but by the end of high school, even that wasn’t the case anymore. It was going out of style.”",
            "Sweda played bass and snare drum in the marching band and developed a relationship with Annica Steen, who played flute and who came out as queer later in high school. For college, Steen chose Grand Valley State University, a public institution just outside Grand Rapids with more than 20,000 students. Sweda opted for Calvin, which had only about 3,000 students and where two of her siblings had gone.",
            "Sweda knew that Calvin’s code for students prohibited intimacy among same-sex couples as part of its demand for chastity outside of marriage. But during campus visits, she’d seen students and instructors wearing pride buttons. She had also taken notice of Calvin’s Sexuality and Gender Awareness (SAGA) peer support group, which it publicized on its website, and a speaker series on sexuality the university had sponsored.",
            "Other prospective students came to Calvin with similar impressions ― among them, Lindsay Owens, who grew up in a conservative, rural Ohio town and who told me she felt out of place there because of her Mexican ethnicity as well as her sexual orientation.",
            "During high school, Owens had attended a summer program at Calvin for racial and ethnic minority students, led by progressive faculty and full of like-minded participants. When it came time to apply for college, she checked out Calvin and saw the SAGA web page. She also took note that the CRC’s position didn’t actually condemn people for being gay, only for acting on it.",
            "“People on my Facebook page will talk about how it’s a perversion or something like that, how it can be cured and all sorts of stuff,” said Owens, who graduated this year. “Calvin doesn’t take that position. … They affirm that God loves you, you’re fine the way you are. They say they just don’t want you to act on it, and that automatically seems more welcoming to people who come from my background.”",
            "But once on campus, Owens and many other students felt as if Calvin’s accommodations had limits. SAGA offered a “safe space” but wasn’t able to operate as an advocacy organization, which it does on other campuses. Resident advisers believed they couldn’t be in LGBTQ relationships, even celibate ones, making it difficult to accept a position that many of them needed to help pay their bills.",
            "The policies themselves are not so clear. In response to written questions, university spokesperson Matthew Kucinski confirmed that the school “discouraged romantic same-sex dating relationships” among resident advisers while adding that “it’s important to note that we’ve never fired an RA for dating someone of the same gender.” He stressed that Calvin is a “caring and diverse community” and said the school has “worked hard to help those within our community who identify as LGBTQ+ to feel a sense of belonging.”",
            "But to students like Owens, the school’s message isn’t ambiguous. “The supports Calvin does have are not like, ‘Let’s celebrate your being queer and let’s celebrate your identity.’ It’s very much, ‘Let’s help you as you’re struggling.’ And that comes off very much like there’s something wrong with you.”",
            "Harm Venhuizen, the student journalist who broke the Kuilema story and graduated this spring, said he can understand how prospective students get the wrong impression. “You come to Calvin and you visit; you might be told there’s an organization for gay students on campus, there are Pride flags around campus,” he told me. “It’s something that exists at Calvin. But it’s something that’s bound, too ― something that is restricted by policy and not as affirming as promotional materials might lead you to think.”",
            "Students weren’t the only ones who felt disappointment. Julia Smith, who was on the Calvin staff and ran the sexuality speaker series from 2008 to 2019, said administrators routinely fielded angry feedback from parents and alumni that sometimes filtered down to her.",
            "In one instance, she said, “an influential person close to big money” sent a long email full of “anti-trans talking points,” pushing her to disinvite a gay speaker. Another time, she said, a manager arranged for a meeting with a parent who objected to the whole approach of exposing students to LGBTQ speakers. The parent wanted to know Smith’s personal view on same-sex marriage. Smith said she refused to answer and feared that, if she had, she might have lost her job.",
            "Sexual orientation wasn’t the underlying issue the first time Kuilema was part of a public controversy.",
            "A 2015 column he wrote about white privilege landed him on the “Professor Watchlist” from the right-wing group Turning Point USA and made him the focus of an article in The Daily Caller, the conservative publication Tucker Carlson founded and was still editing at the time. (Headline: “Professor Blames White Privilege for the Existence of Michigan.”)",
            "When the publicity led to a wave of angry emails and social media posts, including a few death threats, more than 100 of Kuilema’s colleagues rallied to his defense with an open letter asking to be part of the same watchlist. It was testimony to the high regard he had among fellow scholars and the main reason he was optimistic about his chances for tenure in 2018, especially because he also had enthusiastic backing from his department and dean.",
            "Kuilema’s final interview with the screening committee went so well that he wrote a Facebook post afterward thanking all of the people who had helped his career ― and noting that he seemed likely to get tenure even though, as he admitted, he had gently poked the administration. The “poke” he had in mind was yet another statement he’d made, during the interview, about his feelings about the LGBTQ community and the church’s posture toward it. He told me he mentioned it for the same reason he did when he first joined the faculty: He thought honesty demanded that he be upfront about his feelings.",
            "But Kuilema didn’t get tenure. The Board of Trustees rejected the recommendations, and in a letter outlining its rationale cited a number of instances (including the Facebook post) when he’d made public or private statements about LGBTQ issues.",
            "The letter noted the tradition of such dissent at Calvin but said it was important to express such disagreement with a “tone” and “strategy” that was more respectful toward the CRC and its positions. “The Board needs more evidence that your communications, whether written or spoken, formal or informal, serve to strengthen the college and the broader Christian community in constructive and transparent ways,” the letter said.",
            "Several professors later told Chimes that they could not recall another instance of the trustees overruling a screening committee recommendation, let alone one that was so strong and backed by so many members of the faculty. But instead of leaving, Kuilema took up the trustees’ offer (which was itself unusual) to stay on at Calvin, with a two-year contract that could be renewed, in order to demonstrate that he could address their concerns.",
            "Kuilema took several steps, like taking care to recruit panelists who held the traditional position for an LGBTQ “teach-in” and giving plenty of emphasis to the CRC’s position during a classroom lecture ― so much so that a student complained it gave short shrift to the pain people experience when they must hide their identities. Kuilema also began working with Micah Watson, a politically conservative, Princeton-educated political scientist who believes the traditional CRC posture on LGBTQ issues represents the most honest reading of Scripture and the confessions.",
            "Watson bristles at the suggestion that the CRC (or Calvin) should “condemn” people for what they feel or desire; in an interview, he said he hopes that both would continue to welcome members of the LGBTQ community. The goal, he said, should be to set clearer standards for behavior and then “be pastoral, understanding and grace-filled” to “those of us who, for whatever reason, have a hard time living up to the standard.”",
            "Kuilema said one reason he sought out Watson was that he wanted to demonstrate he could engage with such arguments and their advocates respectfully, which was something else the trustees had questioned. Kuilema told me later that the collaboration helped him sort out his own thoughts ― and that he has enjoyed getting to know the more senior professor, whom he considers a friend.",
            "Watson said pretty much the same thing about Kuilema, describing him as intellectually serious, well-versed in Scripture and full of integrity.",
            "“I like Joe,” he said.",
            "On the day of the wedding, Kuilema said, he was calm for the first time in weeks.",
            "Early in his remarks, he followed the couple’s request to memorialize their union as significant without turning the ceremony into a political statement. He mentioned the “difficult and painful decisions about who is safe to be open with” that the two had frequently faced ― and how, just a few years prior, “we would not have been able to stand here and legally marry you.” Then he spoke about their relationship, echoing the sentiments of his old senior class paper and throwing in a corny joke about the two former marching band performers making music together.",
            "“You have built your relationship together, with few models for how to do so or what it might look like, and you have built something beautiful,” Kuilema said.",
            "The ceremony went well, and so did the celebration, despite some morning rain and a lack of fall colors that Sweda and Steen had hoped for when they picked the October date. They danced to “Golden Hour” by Kacey Musgraves and managed to get a few bites of the beef tenderloin and goat cheese-stuffed mushrooms from the buffet. Sweda said she felt disappointed that one college friend had opted not to attend, apparently because the friend’s husband objected to the ceremony on principle. But they still had about 150 guests, including some other Calvin faculty, alumni and students.",
            "“The overriding emotion was just joy,” Kuilema said. “It was such a beautiful day.”",
            "Sweda and Steen told me they were careful when posting about the wedding on social media, consciously excluding photos of Kuilema presiding because they didn’t want anybody to accuse him of using the wedding to make a public statement. To this day, neither they nor Kuilema knows who sent the image to Toly, the provost ― and Toly wouldn’t tell me.",
            "But when the summons to the meetings came, both Kuilema and Sweda knew something was amiss. Sweda told me she got even more scared when the other officials present began the meeting with a prayer, asking for God’s help to give her peace. “It felt very ominous,” Sweda said.",
            "It took a few weeks for administrators to sort out her situation. Eventually they cut ties with the research center where she worked, allowing it to operate independently. The decision took many faculty members by surprise, but it meant that the center was free of Calvin’s personnel rules and Sweda could have a job.",
            "Kuilema wasn’t so lucky. In April, he got a five-page, single-spaced memo from the dean, Benita Wolters-Fredlund, acknowledging his “stellar record” as a scholar, teacher and colleague, and quoting several professors who gushed at length about his work. But, Wolters-Fredlund explained, the decision to preside at the wedding and failure to consult anybody in the top echelons of campus governance was a “serious lapse in judgment” that threatened the university’s integrity, especially given that Sweda was a Calvin employee.",
            "Because of this judgment lapse, Wolters-Fredlund said, the university was not renewing his contract.",
            "The memo made it clear that Kuilema could file an appeal, which he promptly set about doing, although he knew it meant winning over some of the same officials who had already ruled against him ― and who were subject to pressures of their own.",
            "Colleges around the country are about to hit a demographic cliff when the population of potential new first-year students will decline by as much as 15% ― enough to threaten financial stability at all but the most elite, sought-after and generously funded schools. The situation is even more dire for colleges that draw heavily from the Midwest, because of out-migration. On top of that, Calvin is still recovering from a period of unrelated financial instability that led to buyouts, layoffs and eliminations of whole departments.",
            "One consequence of that pressure is that campus controversies can have serious fiscal implications, especially when they touch on hot-button political issues of interest to powerful alumni. A former Calvin official told me it was widely known that a number of major donors was angry and in some cases stopped providing contributions after all the national publicity about Claire Murashima, who in 2020 came out as Calvin’s first openly queer student body president.",
            "Current Calvin officials wouldn’t comment on that except to point out that donor reactions to news are common and run in both directions. But nationally, “it’s often the donors and conservative trustees who are opposed to full LGBTQ inclusion,” according to Jonathan Coley, an Oklahoma State University sociologist and author of “Gay on God’s Campus: Mobilizing for LGBT Equality at Christian Colleges and Universities.” At Calvin, it’s no secret that one high-profile university supporter, Allan Hoekstra, resigned from the Board of Trustees in 2020 at least partly because of the school’s handling of LGBTQ students.",
            "Hoekstra is president of a real estate holding company in nearby Holland, Michigan. He is also a prominent figure in conservative circles with ties to the DeVos and Prince families, who together form one of the most powerful dynasties in national right-wing politics. (As of mid-2020, according to tax filings, Hoekstra was secretary/treasurer of the Edgar and Elsa Prince Foundation, which has in the past financed Focus on the Family, the Family Research Council and other organizations promoting a Christian conservative agenda.)",
            "Among the DeVos and Prince family members who received their undergraduate degrees at Calvin is Betsy DeVos, the conservative activist who has championed Christian schooling and served as education secretary in the Trump administration. One of the largest donations in Calvin’s history was a pair of $10 million contributions, one each from DeVos and Prince family foundations, that underwrote construction of the DeVos Communications Center and the Prince Conference Center. The DeVos center is now home to an institute that focuses on Christianity and public life.",
            "In 2021, Hoekstra wrote an email to several officials and professors in which he recounted some of the reasons he’d stepped away from the board a year earlier. He mentioned some recent university-sponsored seminars on inclusiveness, one of which he called a “roadshow,” as well as a story he had heard about a Calvin graduate who “had a double mastectomy, changed her identity from she to he and married her female partner.”",
            "“Parents and students have the right to believe teaching at Calvin will reflect that sex has its rightful place in the context of a marriage between one man and one woman,” Hoekstra wrote. “I could not remain as a trustee, who had executed the very same Covenant as you, knowing that faculty members were endorsing same sex marriage and the board and administration was unwilling to hold them accountable to the prescribed process.”",
            "Kuilema told me he thinks he’s the professor in the email, although he can’t be sure. Hoekstra declined to answer questions about either the email or his broader feelings about the school.",
            "As for the reference to parents, that resonates with what a number of people in the greater Calvin universe told me about the school, the image and its future as a financially stable institution. “Some parents send their children to Calvin, or to some other Christian school, in order to stop them from being gay,” said Smith, who ran the speaker series.",
            "“It doesn’t actually work that way,” she added quickly. But in the face of a shrinking enrollment pool, and given that families with more affirming attitudes might be less interested in a religious school anyway, Calvin has a strong incentive to make sure the school remains appealing to families who expect it to remain a bulwark against a culture increasingly supportive of the LGBTQ community.",
            "“The market really plays to conservative Christians in the Christian college orbit,” said Kristin Du Mez, a history professor and author of the 2020 bestseller “Jesus and John Wayne: How White Evangelicals Corrupted a Faith and Fractured a Nation.”",
            "Kuilema started the 23-page letter appealing the school’s decision on his contract by recounting his deep ties to the college.",
            "“I love Calvin University,” he wrote, noting that both his parents and his wife were graduates and that he had been part of campus life since he was a kid. He also spoke about his faith and its centrality to his work: “I love the idea of being ‘reformed and always reforming according to the word of God,’ the sense that God is alive and active, moving and working in God’s creation, and that we return again and again to God’s word to discern and confess what each new moment demands of us.”",
            "Under faculty guidelines, a successful appeal requires demonstration of procedural errors or injustices ― or relevant information that university officials lacked while making their decision. Kuilema said there were several, arguing that faculty guidelines were unclear about the restrictions on conduct and whose permission he needed to seek. He argued that his church, not Calvin officials, were the rightful arbiters of whether his actions violated CRC doctrine. He also recounted his efforts to demonstrate he could live up to the standards in the tenure denial letter while reprising some of his substantive critiques of the CRC position.",
            "By this time, his case was getting media attention and public support ― through those online alumni and faculty petitions, plus an opinion article in Chimes, written by psychology professor Emily Helder, hailing his contributions and warning that “I am finding it increasingly difficult to work at Calvin with integrity.”",
            "It was amid the growing outcry that I met with Noah Toly at his campus office on a rainy day in early May.",
            "Toly is something of an outsider at Calvin. He’s not from the Midwest and didn’t grow up in the CRC, although he belonged to churches with similar theological bearings. He came to Calvin from Wheaton College, the evangelical Protestant school in Illinois where he was an undergraduate and then a professor of urban studies and politics. His 2020 book, “The Gardeners’ Dirty Hands: Environmental Politics and Christian Ethics,” uses Greek and biblical texts to think through debates about climate change, which he believes is real and requires policy responses. Its theme is the need to recognize and accept the tradeoffs ― even painful ones.",
            "Toly maintained the institution’s silence on the specifics of the Kuilema case but addressed some of the broader issues it raised for an institution like Calvin ― including the apparent tension between academic freedom and fealty to biblical authority, which, Toly said, didn’t really exist in the way many outsiders imagine.",
            "“We assume that God has made that world both good and intelligible to us and has called us and equipped us for vocations of serious intellectual inquiry,” he said, calling Calvin’s commitment to academic freedom one of its great virtues. “And we believe that that inquiry is not going to lead us to conclusions that are against the grain of God’s truth as revealed in Scripture or taught by the church.”",
            "When I pressed Toly about the obligations of faculty who find CRC positions on issues like same-sex marriage objectionable and who believe Scripture is on their side, he said the university respects the right to dissent.",
            "But, he said, “the expectation to abide by those positions remains even for those who disagree.”",
            "Calvin’s position will only become more precarious following the big Synod vote this past week, which makes opposition to same-sex relationships a matter of confessional status ― in other words, something that congregations can’t violate. Many observes believe it will turn the existing divide over sexuality within the denomination into a potentially irreparable breach, in ways that resemble the broader polarization of U.S. politics.",
            "Congregations with more affluent, more highly educated members are more likely to recognize LGBTQ relationships. Many of them are in and around Grand Rapids, whose downtown is full of bars and restaurants with pride flags. One of churches recently elected a deacon who is in a same-sex marriage.",
            "Congregations in more rural areas and with more blue-collar members are more likely to have the traditional view, that same-sex marriage and homosexual activity more generally is sinful. So do many foreign chapters within the CRC, which have been providing a critical source of new membership at a time when churchgoing across denominations in the U.S. is falling. During the debate at the Synod, those foreign CRC congregations were among those supporting adoption of the stricter human sexuality standard, according to an account in The Banner.",
            "It could take a few years for the results of the Synod vote on sexuality to take full effect as the denomination goes through its own process of bureaucratic implementation. But there’s already widespread talk of individual churches breaking away from the CRC. At Calvin, prominent faculty, such as history professor Du Mez, are openly questioning what it all means for the denomination and the school.",
            "“I can say that whereas before I’ve always felt like I belonged at Calvin and within the CRC, that’s now an open question,” Du Mez told me. “And I think it is for many of us.”",
            "Whatever Calvin’s future, Kuilema won’t be part of it.",
            "In late May, he got a letter from Bruce Los, chair of the Board of the Trustees. It was just two pages and conspicuously lacking in the pleasantries of earlier communications. It disputed Kuilema’s claims, concluding that he failed to show either process errors or incomplete information in the university decision. Absent those two conditions, Los said, there was no grounds for reversal.",
            "Los said the university’s decision did not represent a substantive judgment on either Calvin or CRC policies toward the LGBTQ community. The core issue, he said, was Kuilema’s failure to work “within college policies and procedures” and to act in ways that would “strengthen the [university] and the broader Christian community in constructive and transparent ways.”",
            "The decision shook other professors, including Rachel Venema, who joined the faculty about the same time that Kuilema did and, like him, has a Calvin undergraduate degree. When we spoke in May, while Kuilema’s appeal was still pending, Venema said she was torn about her future.",
            "“The hardest thing, I think, has been seeing LGBTQ students wrestle with this,” she explained. “What does this mean for them? And can they still be here? I really want them to know that there are still plenty of people on campus who are affirming of their identity and their relationships. But I also feel like my CV, like having worked at Calvin for 13 years, is starting to become a sort of a liability in the field of social work. I think that there may be some assumptions about who I am and what I think about same-sex relationships ― things that aren’t true. And so I feel like I need to be on the record in some way.”",
            "Last week, Venema revealed her plans in an email to colleagues. She has decided to leave.",
            "One other question I asked Toly was about prospective students who identify as queer. What advice would he give them about attending Calvin? He was unequivocal: He said he hoped that they would come, that they would feel like they would be loved. He noted that the rules against intimacy outside of marriage apply equally to students of all sexual orientations. Asking for celibacy might seem like a lot, he acknowledged, but college is just four years.",
            "“We all at various points in our lives join communities or institutions that have rules or norms we wouldn’t make ourselves,” Toly said. “We often find ourselves submitting to those rules or norms, for a season at least.”",
            "I put the same questions to the students and alumni I interviewed, including those who now identify as part of the LGBTQ community. The responses varied, with some saying it was worth coming to Calvin in order to push it in a more progressive direction and others saying the difficulties were simply too great.",
            "Sweda said she would advise queer students to go to secular colleges, although she says some don’t have that choice because their parents won’t pay tuition if they don’t attend Christian schools. “The point a lot of people miss is that, for a lot of queer students... there is some sort of financial or family coercion going on there.” Sweda has actually set up a GoFundMe, which she says she uses to help LGBTQ Calvin students while on campus.",
            "A very real possibility is that Calvin could evolve over the next few years so that it has fewer students like Sweda and fewer professors like Kuilema, creating a campus and academic environment both more aligned with CRC teachings and more insulated from the culture around it. Universities like Bob Jones, Liberty and Oral Roberts offer a possible glimpse of that future.",
            "They have never had Calvin’s reputation for intellectual diversity. And although those schools have LGBTQ students, over the years many have spoken about the shame and stigma they feel, even instances of abuse, while experts and advocates worry about the toll on the students’ mental health. This was the biggest concern I heard over and over again from former staff who worked with LGBTQ students ― their fears for students struggling with issues of identity and sexual orientation, maybe for the first time and perhaps without sympathetic families.",
            "“There’s no such thing as just giving a philosophical and theological message like this without affecting someone’s well-being, because people internalize it,” said Kelsey Colburn, who was coordinator of student success and sexuality programming from 2019 to 2021. “If you’re telling queer young people … that [they] shouldn’t be able to be in relationships, then they end up wrestling with that themselves internally and thinking maybe I’m not OK, maybe there’s something wrong with me, maybe God doesn’t want me this way. And that can lead to severe mental health problems. I’ve seen it.”",
            "As for Kuilema, he has a wife, a toddler and two baby twins. For all of the recent discussion about morality and student well-being, Scripture and institutional integrity, Kuilema is still a working parent with bills to pay. When I called him last week, he was on the job market, looking for a faculty position at another institution.",
            "I asked him how he was feeling, given that Calvin has been part of his life for as long as he can remember, and whether he now wished he had made a different decision about the wedding. He admitted to some emotional ups and downs, likening them to the process of a grieving cycle, but added, “I strongly believe that it was the right thing to do, that it was consistent with everything that I believe. I wish we had been able to find a way to work it out, but I don’t regret officiating at all.”",
            "A few days later he was back at Calvin for a protest against the Synod vote. He brought his kids, calling it a “family tradition.”"

            "NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. on Saturday opened COVID-19 vaccines to infants, toddlers and preschoolers.",
            "The shots will become available next week, expanding the nation’s vaccination campaign to children as young as 6 months.",
            "Advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended the vaccines for the littlest children, and the final signoff came hours later from Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the agency’s director.",
            "“We know millions of parents and caregivers are eager to get their young children vaccinated, and with today’s decision, they can,” Walensky said in a statement.",
            "While the Food and Drug Administration approves vaccines, it’s the CDC that decides who should get them.",
            "The shots offer young children protection from hospitalization, death and possible long-term complications that are still not clearly understood, the CDC’s advisory panel said.",
            "The government has already been gearing up for the vaccine expansion, with millions of doses ordered for distribution to doctors, hospitals and community health clinics around the country.",
            "Roughly 18 million kids will be eligible, but it remains to be seen how many will ultimately get the vaccines. Less than a third of children ages 5 to 11 have done so since vaccination opened up to them last November.",
            "Here are some things to know:",
            "WHAT KINDS ARE AVAILABLE?",
            "Two brands — Pfizer and Moderna — got the green light Friday from the FDA and Saturday from the CDC. The vaccines use the same technology but are being offered at different dose sizes and number of shots for the youngest kids.",
            "Pfizer’s vaccine is for children 6 months to 4 years old. The dose is one-tenth of the adult dose, and three shots are needed. The first two are given three weeks apart, and the last at least two months later.",
            "Moderna’s is two shots, each a quarter of its adult dose, given about four weeks apart for kids 6 months through 5 years old. The FDA also approved a third dose, at least a month after the second shot, for children with immune conditions that make them more vulnerable to serious illness.",
            "HOW WELL DO THEY WORK?",
            "In studies, vaccinated youngsters developed levels of virus-fighting antibodies as strong as young adults, suggesting that the kid-size doses protect against coronavirus infections.",
            "However, exactly how well they work is hard to pin down, especially when it comes to the Pfizer vaccine.",
            "Two doses of Moderna appeared to be only about 40% effective at preventing milder infections at a time when the omicron variant was causing most COVID-19 illnesses. Pfizer presented study information suggesting the company saw 80% with its three shots. But the Pfizer data was so limited — and based on such a small number of cases — that experts and federal officials say they don’t feel there is a reliable estimate yet.",
            "SHOULD MY LITTLE ONE BE VACCINATED?",
            "Yes, according to the CDC’s advisers. While COVID-19 has been the most dangerous for older adults, younger people, including children, can also get very sick.",
            "Hospitalizations surged during the omicron wave. Since the start of the pandemic, about 480 children under age 5 are counted among the nation’s more than 1 million COVID-19 deaths, according to federal data.",
            "“It is worth vaccinating even though the number of deaths are relatively rare, because these deaths are preventable through vaccination,” said Dr. Matthew Daley, a Kaiser Permanente Colorado researcher who sits on the CDC’s advisory committee.",
            "WHICH VACCINE SHOULD MY CHILD GET?",
            "Either one, said Dr. Peter Marks, the FDA’s vaccine chief.",
            "“Whatever vaccine your health care provider, pediatrician has, that’s what I would give my child,’’ Marks said Friday.",
            "The doses haven’t been tested against each other, so experts say there’s no way to tell if one is better.",
            "One consideration: It takes roughly three months to complete the Pfizer three-shot series, but just one month for Moderna’s two shots. So families eager to get children protected quickly might want Moderna.",
            "WHO’S GIVING THE SHOTS?",
            "Pediatricians, other primary care physicians and children’s hospitals are planning to provide the vaccines. Limited drugstores will offer them for at least some of the under-5 group.",
            "U.S. officials expect most shots to take place at pediatricians’ offices. Many parents may be more comfortable getting the vaccine for their kids at their regular doctor, White House COVID-19 coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha said. He predicted the pace of vaccination will be far slower than it was for older populations.",

            "CAN CHILDREN GET OTHER VACCINES AT THE SAME TIME?",
            "It’s common for little kids to get more than one vaccine during a doctor’s visit.",
